1,¬†Alexa cannot hear after she starts playing
2,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don't have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. ""Alexa please play the flying jat song"". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart!  Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days  I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it's easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime ""Alexa Bulb on"" or ""Alexa bulb off"" voice command doesn't work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly."
3,"/*Here I'm Uploading video, enjoy*/Most idiotic device I every bought, never play original songs. Always play some or the other remix or instrumental songs.I wish I would have bought Google home or some Bluetooth speakers./*Some attachments after talking to Amazon Echo Dot Executive*/After my above review, Echo Dot representative called me, I'm glad for this.I showed him the issue with song selection but he told me that it is because of library doesn't have songs that I'm selecting and it is better to add gaana.com from alexa app, after following his guidelines, I repeated and recorded issues. Please see the screen shots and listed to audio  for Alexa and have fun (Now I realise amazon review doen't support audio but only video).You can buy this device if you have to have personalised fun in your life. The is not way of attaching Audio files only video so this is again funny, if I wan't to attach some feedback for Alexa why do I need Video :). This is called mismatch in basic requirement.I'll try to get capture view than attach here for same issues added as image. Till than enjoy."
4,¬†Do not buy this product. When i asked alexa that kashmir is part of which country it said china.Boycott alexa
5,Its just one if the best deal i ever got on amazon I purchased it with a 12 watt wipro light at 2200 and enjoying it since last 2 daya its my 4th echo device and yes I would highly recommend buying a product with this just search echo dot wall mount you ll see a 800-900 rupees wall mount trust me it will make a huge difference between sound and transportability plus when its on wall if will recognise your voice quicker as it faces you on the wall seriously guys the combination of these two is compulsory
6,¬†Worst experience with alexa no warranty you get with this product.Amazon policy are worst. Ctdi partner an official amazon devices service partner.I have requested to Amazon to replace my alexa device with in the warranty period the refuses my request. issue is escalated bu amazon team but no follow up call can be held till today. They are giving fake excuses for service they are temporary un available for service of alexa after few days the warranty get to expire then they say your product warranty has expired so we did not give you a service for your product. ‚Äú excuse me amazon all of the world wide companies change their policies in national lockdown.‚Äù I think amazon policy are worst. They stand in the last of the top companies list. They have no customer satisfaction. Even apple has extended there warranty of their product in lockdown. Amazon shame Amazon shameful for you
7,"Before buying this product please keep these points in mind:- You need amazon prime account  for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software  and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products."
8,"I am using alexa dot 2nd Gen and today I have gifted dot 3rd Gen to my Daddy.1. I see of difference in sound quality compared 2nd gen. Sound quality is amazing.2. It is louder than 2nd Gen Dot3. One thing disappointed is that when say 'Alexa, play old telugu songs' in 2nd Gen Dot it Play old songs from retro station but in 3rd gen Dot it is playing telugu songs'(not telugu old songs). When I specially say 'Alexa play telugu retro station songs' it is playing old songs of specific combination of male and female singers.I will update the review after days again but it's 5 star rating for now"
9,"¬†Works beautifully, have bought 3 to link the entire house. Frequently group and play them together, use drop in to create an intercom, and have linked to speakers, bulbs, TV and other gadgets. I would still give this only 3 stars because it is double the rate here in India compared to the US. A country with 25 TIMES India's per capita income. What is this pricing Amazon? I understand there may be taxes in India but still. 2X the price ?This not withstanding will buy a larger Echo speaker whenever there is a sale on Echo with reasonable prices."
10,For 2000 using 10% off..you are getting a bulb worth 500...making echo dot 1500 which at roughly 20 dollars is same price you get in deals in USA.  So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!!  Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers.  This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness.  While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that.  Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times.  Just grab this before it goes back to its old price.  Even the smart bulb is very helpful.  While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb.  Just go for it before its too late
11,"I was quite confused between echo dot 3rd & 4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing, I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons.1. Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360¬∞ view.8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.9. Can fit into confined space.10. Also paid only ‚Çπ1999.What more one can ask for."
12,"¬†Bought this and wipro 9w smart bulb in combo offer. Configured smart bulb in alexa. Cool thats it.Just say ""alexa, lights on"", ""alexa, turn light to red / blue"" etc.. you can alse even change the brightness ""alexa, change the brightness to 50%"" etc. You will get the manual within the wipro bulb box. There you can see the list of commands.Lets see the other options of echo dot. I connected this to home theater. It is just playing songs from any music station, my playlist. Tried these 2 options only. Mostly i play rhymes. Around INR 2500, i got this combo. Worth to play around."
13,"me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I do not know that""me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I could not find that""me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I don't recognize it""search capabilities of Alexa sucks!! Even when I read out the playlist names as they are on Amazon Music, Alexa can't find those playlists. Alexa know a standard playlists like 90s bollywood, bollywood hits etc., If you are looking for Kannada playlists or for that matter any local language lists, Alexa just does not know...me ""Alexa, I have feedback"" ""You really suck!!"""
14,"""Worst experience brought it on 12th August already stopped working since 25th September @Amazon what should be done suggest""This was my previous review but now i am amazed with customer service i got from Amazon. The adaptor for Alexa was faulty..so after the review Amazon came to know about my problem and without any delay they help me with a new adaptor without any cost.In this way within a day my issue is resolved. Thankyou Mr.Aman for your promp response and solution will never forget it.so all these stars are not for Alexa now but for Amazon üôÇu won my ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,"This review is for the Echo dot (3rd gen).On the Hardware front, the device is quite good(maybe best in the market) at this price, only one thing I would want it to have is a battery inside as you have to connect it to a power source always, which makes it less portable and for scenarios when there is an electricity cut (well we live in India-a developing country, here many areas even in the top cities don't have 24 hrs of electricity, Amazon would have considered this)The software front is just average.If you have used google assistant(Ok Google) on mobile/any device then you can think as Alexa answers just around 50% efficiently compared to google assistant (according to me). Alexa doesn't understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say ""Alexa"" first for everything, and it also doesn't understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?-->it just says I don't know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills' library so you can automate/routine many things.On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose."
16,"I am returning after trying various commands for about a week. This is a recent review.Received only 2 days ago. So initial impressions.Not checked integration. Oakremote that I purchased with Echo was a flop.+ves -Voice recognition , Quick response, Family is having fun giving commands-ves: It generally plays music from Amazon music library. THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD. Sounds like 19th century radio. It works only when Wifi and Electricity are available.I am keeping it for the novelty and as a sample of future AI. Would be happy if it lasted atleast till 2022 Diwaliüòú"
17,"In comparison with Google voice assistant devices -1. Eco dot 3 is awesome in hardware - mic recognises voice from far away distance and bass on speaker is super.2. But software experience is pathetic due to alexa which is not even 10% of google assistant. Very limited recognition of command and that too hit or miss by alexa.3. Alexa catches one command unlike combined commands in Google assistant.4. Unproductive things like telling jokes are only features of alexa. It can't even calculate dates.On/off smart plug & reminders are the only perfectly working things with Alexa !!!In layman terms - Google is hero and Alexa is joker.Limitations in speaker -Note that only 3.5mm output is possible, so eco dot 3 can't be used as 3.5mm speaker but can be used as Bluetooth speaker.You can't use mic in Bluetooth mode. So, not usable for calls.Alexa app -is inconsistent and not user-friendly. Critical features like alexa guard are not available in India.Voice recognition -It's always hit or miss with simple commands also.I bought to play online kannada music but voice recognition is limited to Bollywood movie names or artists for Indian music.It won't recognise 99% kannada music/movie/artist names.My VERDICT -Even though I got in DEC 2021 for 2299, I'm finding it useless. My usage is restricted to on/off smart plug at water heater and reminders, as reminders with 5 out 5 times whereas it's 4/5 with Google.Alexa ignored Kannada and all other South Indian languages, so time for us to ignore alexa and go with Google devices if South Indian languages are your need.Don't waste your money on alexa voice assistant devices."
18,"worst product amazon released into market in a hurry. Here are some, if not all, of the issues:1 - No sound clarity. Even from 4 feet one cant understand what alexa saying. muffled voice2 - Limited capability. Other than weather it doesn't know any significant much. I didnt buy it for weather or switch on a bulb.3 - Dont understand english language properly.4 -Its useless overall for anything and for anyone, be it kids or adults.Amazon has a long way to go before it can make it usefull."
19,"¬†Got it with Wipro smart LED bulb bundle. In 1999 both.Pros:Solid build quality.Easy setup.Capture voice even far from 10 feet.Loud and clear sound.Bass is awesome.Easy connection to your smart LED bulb.Capture all voice just anybody called ""Alexa"". It will respond.Cons:No battery inside, you need to put in its power adapter all the time.Works only if active internet connection available.You should have wifi at home to connect all devices together."
20,"Well amazon did a great job they explain every pros on their details*Only thing is alexa is in beta stage may be it will take some more years for this AI to work like google assistant, because most of the time alexa says "" ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§ù‡•á ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡§™‡§§‡§æ""*Interaction in hindi is better than google assistant*Sould quality is better than my expectations*Got it on amazon GIF with wipro bulb @2300rs with 100 of cashback ‚úåüèª* in winter season i don't need to go out from my quilt to switch of my home devices üòÇüòÇ Thanks amazon* Good for my parents as they can ask most of the things to alexa because they r in a phase of learning smartphones features* Only buy if u heave a wifi router, will not work good with mobile hot-spot* Smart devices most of them only supports 2.4Ghz wifi router* Smart devices cost a lot as compare to normal electronics, with this speaker u need to spend extra bucks to make your home more smarterPS- Add motion sensing LED to ur home with smart LED ... It looks cool and u dont need to shout a lot to turn it off or on and the bottom line is they r more cheaper ‚úåüèª"
21,"The speaker was larger than I thought it would be, a bit chunky but not too heavy. It doesn't move about, because it's nicely weighted, even if played at full volume though I believe 50-60% volume would be enough for most people. The sound is very good indeed. The Bollywood and dance songs play great and even the rock and metal songs are enjoyable. The bass is not very heavy but the sound seems weighted nice for bass heavy songs. Alexa makes it so easy to do so many things, especially if you have smart appliances and lights and all at home which are compatible. Sone things I find enjoyable are asking Alexa to turn on the tv via my smart plug and play a particular show on the fire tv stick and by the time I get to the living room everything's on and the show's about to start. You can even use it to call your family to dinner if you have two or more echo speakers. Some privacy issues are there but it's up to you how comfortable you are giving up some for the convenience it provides. Playing music, the news, weather updates, traffic updates, reading your Kindle library books to you, the possibilities are endless. Spotify too is very nicely integrated with Alexa. The only downside is that the Google feud means there's no YouTube or YouTube music support officially and you have to run through some hoops to get it working (P.S. look up Paul Hibbert on YouTube [oh the irony]). P.P.S.-Amit Bachchan's voice is now available via Amitji keyword but unfortunately you have to pay extra for it :)"
22,"It‚Äôs an amazing product to have, especially the integration with your google calendar and tons of skills to play around with. Though hoping there will be more better software updates, butIt‚Äôs a bang on product for the price. Bought wipro bulb and echo dot together for 2449Rs and then returned the wipro bulb and got back 700Rs. So got the Alexa for just 1750Rs, which is truely a bang on for a smart assistant and a Bluetooth speaker ;)"
23,"I like Alexa and the features. But rated 3 due to the below facts.- No inbuilt battery. A big minus. In today's mobile world, you cannot enforce the device to be plugged in always.- No USB charging facility- Alexa app is horribly slow- The moment your wifi connection changes, it cannot detect. You need to reconfigure itPlus features- Device shape is great- Sound quality is superb- Voice response is awesome"
24,"This device refused to set up because the Alexa app just didn't work on my mother's phone. I had bought this for her. I even tried signing out of the Alexa app on my phone and then tried logging into her account on my phone and as soon as I would log in, the app would go blank.I'm still confident that there is nothing wrong with the Echo device but there is a problem in the Alexa app. More specifically there is a problem with my mother's account on the Alexa app. Unfortunately there is no way to fix this or talk to any kind of customer support. Customer support is a chat bot which has a preset list of questions that you need to select. There is no way to get any support for the app.My suggestion would be to stay away from such 'dumb' smart speakers. Amazon US is very helpful, because the laws in  that country require them to be. Amazon in India sucks when it comes to Alexa app support, because there is no way to talk/ chat to someone who can check the account.Its strange that my worst purchase from Amazon is actually an Amazon product and not something sold by a listed seller."
25,"The product has intermittent issue while connecting with Phone for playing videos sound.  Spoke with Amazon Tech support, they went ahead with raising replacement after some troubleshooting. Now, they picked the device. Though no replacement update.  Nothing in the app which indicates that the product has been picked up or replacement has been sent.Moreover the device itself dont have connectivity with ZOOM app and for calling  in India. Though the feature is available in other countries through Echo Connect feature.Hope they will sent the replacement."
26,"Alexa is horribly wrong and Dumb..I made a mistake by not buying google mini speaker..Alexa has no answers...It is a stupid speaker..I know u need to enable the skills and all that..However, it is still a very bad Assistant..Fully disssatisfied..Audio quality is good but one can buy a simple bluetooth speaker at 1/3rd the cost rather than messing ur mind up with such an incapable AI speaker.. It cannot answer 90% of your questions.Used with Fireststick: limited usage and that too with limited apps.Will still need the remote anyway. Not much useful with Firestick.I strongly suggest please Buy google home mini instead..Audio may be a bit less but the google assistant is amazing.."
27,"We purchased Gen3.  The voice of assistance is too heavy. No equalizer settings.  App has a very poor design and functionality.  Sound of music is rich, but very poor in high frequency (treble), bass is good as per the size of speaker.  Overall, good to hear music.  AI is just okay, has very limited AI features, Mobile's Google voice is way more intelligent in answering questions.  Good for wakeup alarms and listening music.  Apps like spotify is very poor as opposed to Advertisement shown.  Youtube selects better song lists rather than Amazon's music or Spotify.  Gaana is still better, but way behind Youtube.  Crux: If you have a small and good quality speaker system, just pair with your mobile and it shall be better; more better if use an old phone as no sms & phones shall disturb.  These smart speakers are always listening (except for mute) ... always leaves me in doubt."
28,"Everytime I connect to the device it says playing from and mentions my device name. This comes at high volume as this volume can only be controlled through the device. But this doesn't end here. Alexa shouts playing from and my device name everytime. If I lock my system and re-login then it shouts this message. If I stay idle and don't move my mouse for 5 mins and then move it then I get this mesaage again. Sometimes it happens when I am playing videos as well. A video will be playing and suddenly Alexa shouts playing from and my device name. Unfortunately even though I tried many things to get rid of that, I wasn't able to get rid of this sound till now. When I connect to Alexa speaker for the first time it doesn't connect properly and it plays with breaking sounds. This happens many times and I have to keep disconnecting and connecting it back till it works properly. Overall it is a fine speaker but there are too many problems that I face everyday with it."
29,"In a word... Just fabulous...Not that much works in queries like Google. But GK level is quite good.For music it's outstanding.Voice recognition, sound quality, the LED ring ... All experiences are just awesome.Don't know about Home assistance, didn't try but didn't work to call or message on any number. Whom you are calling need to be added with your Alexa Profile. Of course you won't give access to outsiders. It's only use for family members only. So it's not useful that much.But After all these ifs & buts... Me & my family members like it very much.."
30,"I bought this as a productivity tool- during the pandemic while I drift between office work and housework, I need something to remind me of upcoming tasks or meetings.  It fails terribly due to lack of  thinking by the designers.1. This devise should require  a password or PIN or recognize the voice of the person before proceeding further.  It should not allow anyone to hijack your device- in my case my 7 year old, who keeps fiddling with the reminders  or moving it away from a central location to his room. ( don't tell me you can't do voice classification, then at least ask a PIN ). For me the device is useless now, as I may not even hear it and important reminders may get removed. 2. The India model at least has no working profanity filter, my son plans music with profanity and there is no way to restrict access.3. Searches sometimes fail miserably- it is not recognition, the problem is the content that is being searched for an answer.  Google's device is probably is stronger here with search results4. The reminders should  have an option to repeat till I turn it off by saying ""acknowledged' or 'done'"
31,"My perception about ambient computing changed after I bought this alexa device and Iam loving this device.Alexa's voice is a bigger USP , such a soothing voiceBest WFH home companionLook up alexa skills and you will be facinated how many thousand skills it has,Check out Alexa skills in amazon website & in alexa mobileAlexa is a platform and Amazon making it better everydayThese are early days of ambient computing and no assistants are perfectYou can use google assistant from ur phone via bluetooth to get essential from google assistantSpeaker Sound quality is decent and won't  hurt your ears.Amazon adding more songs to  Amazon music and if you have prime subscription you are gonna enjoySpotify integration with Alexa is intuitive with free spotify accountWe can set out Alexa routines and blueprint feature is awesomeIOT connectivity  is seemlessAlexa reads news from Ndtv , TOI, ET, and more.Alexa market share is more than google nest,so developers line up for alexa than googleThank you amazon for creating this best Alexa speakerMuch loveAlexa user"
32,"This review is after using echo dot gen 3 more than 2 months. While there are both Pros and Cons, this is a good device to enter into connected devices world.Pros:1. Good looking gels nicely with the environment.2. LED ring gets your attention when in need.3. Good sound quality on playback.Cons so far:1. Sound is muffled for the responses from Alexa, you can't make out clearly on what it says most of the time. No fix yet { reduced one star because of this. }. Due to this issues it's being used as just a music player most of the time.2. Compared to Google Mini, Alexa's search contextual hits are lower.3. Was unable to get Follow-up working properly."
33,"The integration with other app is difficult and many times it unable to perform well with voice recoginitionFlaws:1.Its difficult to pair it with smart switch and bulbs.i was not successful,in doing so2.voice recognition sucks3.the help provided ia not good at all.not a good assistqnt.4.cannot plqy music or video from yputube5.no proper help for automating6.cannot use it as output speaker with my projector7. Simple automation scripts for pairing should be provided as a sample so that ppl can directly reuse them8.it only search songs from limited platforms.that huge disappojntmentNot satisfied at all.Only thing that I like is sound of speaker"
34,"A great device to get started, echo dot is a great device to first know your requirement. Alexa is integrated well enough but the voice recognition will give you trouble in later stages as it fails to recognise simple regular commands after a while, you will only see the blue light which after taking no action will turn off and resume the ongoing task. Many times it will disappoint and embarrass you, can only hope it to get better in future.Update:After using it for 1 year i would say it isn't that good of a device, now out of 10 times calling itout, it wouldd hardly respond twice. May be they have made the 4th gen better in this aspect but this device if you're even getting at a discounted price of 1k, don't bother. Not worth your money."
35,"Got a sweet prime day combo deal on this and this is my second purchase of this device. For the price and the ease of use and integration, I am very happy with it. I only wish it had a chargeable feature to go alongside it to make it truly portable but I guess Amazon has other devices which cater to that need.I really haven't used the offerings from google and apple in this category so will not compare but just for itself, this device is a charm."
36,"Hello,I purchased this from somewhere else.. After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that ""She couldn't find anything"" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or GoogleIf you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference."
37,"Sound Quality was unexpected from such a small device with a single small speaker. I enjoy FM radio (through skill) everyday. This is very useful as analog FM reception in our area is very bad. Through skills it reminds me of my medication.  Command detection is mostly accurate. But when searching for music, it plays wrong songs at times may be because of the very limited music collection with amazon. Pairing with a second Bluetooth speaker using ""discover"" command is not working unless you remove the already paired device using Alexa app. I wish the alarms and reminders had user programmable/uploadable bells/voices as there is only one sound in the alarm settings."
38,1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.
39,"Echo Dot is a good speaker and voice recognition is quite impressive. However, Alexa integration is still in the development phase. So be prepared to get frustrated.If you are someone who loves the old classics, you will find Alexa very disappointing. And don't forget, you need Amazon Music's premium account to be able to stream music on Echo Dot. That also means, Akexa will play only that music which is available on Amazon Music. I'm not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!I don't have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It's totally fun.Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can't easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like ""Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki..."" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called ""Ai Watan"" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked. Clearly, the music that Alexa offers has been selected by Amazon keeping in mind today's teens. And this won't change.Update: January 10, 2021Almost two years since purchaseThe device is still as good as it was when bought. However, it seems Amazon has made no efforts to improve their music libraries. Their focus is still only to cater to the youth, not those who love soft soulful music. When I ask Alexa to play songs of Md. Rafi, for example, she will only play noisy ones like ""Chaahe koyi mujhe jungle kahe..."". She will never include songs like ""Ik haseen shaam ko dil mera kho gayaa..."" even if the song is available in Amazon Music. The Amazon team thinks only college goers listen to its music. This is one of the reasons why I can not recommend Amazon's voice assisted speakers to friends."
40,"¬†Sound quality is good,fast response,easy to use.it is a good product and for those who are not much aware about the technology they can also operate easily.you can listen news and if you are feeling bored alexa can tell you good jokes.i m also using wipro smart bulb with Alexa and it is working awesome.i found only one issue sometimes alexa does not respond I think because when we give command from long distance I mean because of mic but overall good product."
41,"Sidhi si bat he iska pure use to sirf jo total sirf computer job vale hi kar shakte he baki to sab sholh k liye lete he,baki normal speakers ki tarah hi use hoga sound limited he ek room k hisab se, baki special search nahi karta kuchh only Amazon, Amazon prime music ,hungama,jese 3 se 5 platforms ko hi use karta he,baki puchho ge to javab milega iske bare me mobile app m jaye ,bss baki shokh pura karo baki naya kuchh nahi lagega"
42,This is useless device.0) it is not listening command properly. And we have to speak loudly.1) It is not connecting through Bluetooth to desktop. After a long research and hard setting it is connected and if we would change any song than audio is not coming. I am frustrated.2) Always need connectivity with internet / Bluetooth to operate any device.3) not playing music easily wherever we want.4) don't waste money if don't have 24 hours internet connection and related smart device.5) from desktop PC it is not connecting from cable and even from Bluetooth adaptor.So please please don't waste your money on it.Not a smart device it is useless device.
43,¬†Overall good quality it is baby rhymes songs and also controls geyser doing well with compared to other versions this is economical and technically goodrecommended for others to buy
44,"Bad software! Alexa is not smart at all.voice recognition is not accurate most of the times but more than that Alexa interpretation leaves lot to be desired. Alexa is a just NLP and works on plain if else or a switch condition rather than being smart device. No where follows the user pattens, voice patterns and the people to come up with suggestions. Most of the times you get fed up with the results and then switch off the device. Mostly none of the songs I want will be played, I end up using it for casting the music from the phone, which anyways normal Bluetooth speaker will do at a less price.Hardly any useful tricks as they call it!Just works as voice command based device rather than a smart speaker!"
45,I got a discount of 1000 for this product during some flash sale and got the product at Rs. 2499. It originally costs 3499. So to buy at this price is a awesome deal. I really appreciate amazon for selling products cheaper than the original cost. These are very friendly and reliable devices that can help you to track any orders or set up an alarm or sing a song on any occasion. Every thing I tried and it works wonder. Definitely a must buy for young people who want to be smart in their day to day activities.
46,"Very nice product, this was my first experience with alexa, overall recognisation and sound quality is good , but it is not pairing with my  VU smart TV.Pros:Sound quality was too goodNo lag or delay in responseCons:-Should work with DC power also with battery backup, always we have to connect with AC power.-Without current you can't use this echo dot- listed very few Android TVs (example VU smart tv is not in the list)-Should enhance on 'Schedule to play any song by scheduled time"
47,"Clear case of breach of contract.I have purchased a an echo dot on prime day sale for 3250 post discount, but they have marked my order as delivered without actually delivering it.I have raised an issue going through ordeal of multiple calls mails and messages over 8days. Finally what I was given is 1600 rupees refund with a sorry message. Ihave lost 1800rupees straight away without even seeing the product.Howmuch every I try to escalate the issue the response will be the same, ""we can't do anything for you and you have to accept whatever happens""Now I'm understanding how corporate bullying works.Please be careful."
48,1. Bina wifi k nhi chalega only speaker bajao Or wo bhi plug üîå k sath laga kar2. Bhut sare information jo Alexa ko pata he nhi hai3.ek baar off hone par dubara connect karne k liye sara wifi Bluetooth connect karna padta hai4.only ye apke waaj nhi parchanta5.har ek dialogue k baad ye chup ho jata haiKul mila jula kar ye Alexa bekar hai isse sakta or acha google home mini mai 1.5 year use kar raha hu
49,"The size to sound ratio is just excellent, the emphasis seems to be on voice but the base is absent so this is not for the base head.This is the most responsive voice integration that I have seen, as you say, Alexa, it starts listing. There are a lot of things that you can ask Alexa like adding a product in your Amazon cart, open rain sound, play music, set alarm, etc.The interesting thing is that Alexa also listing commands in Hindi as well. This is only a part of the home automation system. All the smart equipment/products you purchase can be connected with Alexa like a light bulb to control it with voice etc. but for that, you need a router in your home.ConclusionThe speaker does not have a battery but he can be connected via Bluetooth from your phone and PC. Which is a good thing but all of a sudden it stops playing for no reason which is very annoying?I got it in INR 2500, at this price you must buy it, just to experience a smart speaker but in INR 3500 it looks a bit expansive. If you decide to buy this then this going to be the first step to transform your home into a smart home."
50,"Feeling pitty on amazon. I have ordered for three product on prime day. But I didn't recieved the product. On the next day itself it says (return recieved) and it was the mistake of courier service and amazon. But when I called the customer service, they ensured me that the placed it again with the same price. But still the status on my dashboard wasn't updated. So I called to customer service again, and he too said same. After 4-5 days I called again, and now they are saying that nothing is updated and I have to place the order again(with today's price). Then what's amazon prime for?! If they can't sell their own product in a wise way.. So disappointing.it was a gift for my brother. And it delayed again. I need a clear action from Amazon service with this matter."
51,"Hi I am using this from the beginning and I have echo 3rd gen ordered from Amazon but nowadays when I uses it, it suddenly gets stop and nothing happens  I have to manually swith off and switch on to resolve the issue, and again it happens please do the needful to help me.."
52,"It is useless device and waste of money it only work with registered WiFi with amazon not with in coming signal of the Alexa app computer or mobile , no one else in the house can use it if registered WiFi is not available and at the same time we can not register two ,three signals . Alexa becomes use less when there is no internet , and there are lot of restrictions like hand free not available when in battery saver mode etc etc . at many a times it can not understand your voice and there are many app's missing in window computer .if i instruct it to teach Gramer to children it can not do . what a useless device it is , i even wanted to buy Fire TV stick but lots of them in used market ,hence i thought there must be some problem like this in that also hence stopped its purchase .My advice to Amazon is make it user friendly . do not restrict to one WiFi signal ,Take the in coming signal or allow us to register two ,three signal there should not restrict Hand free etc .With RegardsRavishankar"
53,"Excellent service provided by the device.. Only problem is with Eco dot 3rd generation device that it‚Äôs only launch an app but never plays a video, especially YouTube.. This feature is a very basic one and should be added with this device which will enhance the product services overall.. Please take it as a consideration. Also it should be connected to atleast 2 Firesticks or 2 TV‚Äôs in a single home.. This should be the minimum. I am very much sure, if these two features could be added with this device, it will enhance the overall service of the product and will reach to many other people in India and thus increase the sale of the product.."
54,"Expensive, Smart speaker works only when plugged in. Bluetooth V2.0 is very old dur to this audio is very poor, sound becomes very low. No battery to support the speaker so if no power you cannot use the device. Sometimes while song change you hear a distorted sound. Not worth the purchase as Bluetooth quality in the speaker is bad. You need to shout then only Alexa can hear you - voice sensor is poor. On full volume Alexa will not recognise your command."
55,"My only disappointment is that it does not have battery and when power goes off it dies.Sound quality is very good, good bass but not like woofer.It can be used as Bluetooth speaker. But not sure if Bluetooth earphones works with it. Will update about it later."
56,"This review is especially for those sitting on the fence .I‚Äôve been using Google Nest and minis and wanted to shift to Echo for its Drop in feature basically .(the full intercom) . It worked fine. But overall Alexa was disappointing. Even after having 4 mics the voice recognition was only a tad better than Google. The sound is natural but artificially natural, a little muffled as well.The app is poor. What takes less than a minute to setup on Google Home it takes over 3-4 minutes on alexa app. I have over 40 smart devices in my home and the time it needed merely setting up those devices was a bummer. Echo or Alexa is is just popular because Amazon sells it while Google devices are not marketed that much."
57,"Better go for Google home..- cannnot make/accept phone calls (only Alexa calls)- cannot place orders on prime now- connected to Samsung smart TV via smart things skill and it can only do basic control like on/off,volume control.-technical customer care is not that good for any support issue.Free Wipro smart light isn't really smart..once power resumes after a power cut you need to switch it off again via app/Alexa.Only worthy use of echo is unlimited music from Amazon music."
58,"I was very excited about this purchase and very happy that I got delivered one day advanced and I tried setting up Alexa but ended up unsuccessful for almost 6 hours. Then decided to call Customer service I requested for call back on 7.05pm evening and I call from them on 7.06pm which was amazing and prompt service. The Agent whom I spoke to was Mr. Sami, he was so polite, professional and spoke to for 45 minutes and finally came to know by the agent that the product which I got was reported as stolen or missing product, So that is why I couldn't complete the set up process. I was completely surprised & confused that how come a very big firm like Amazon can deliver a stolen product to their customers and the agent managed to replaceml the product and he gave me end to end service. I was happy with customers service not with Amazon service"
59,"After 3 months here are the things which I found.Works better if you have connection of minimum 20 mbps.I have started to get few bugs or software issue.Alexa listens sometimes by itself and says, 'sorry, I don't know that.'Sometimes songs stops playing in middle by itself.It doesn't recognise voice even after activating it many times.After command it doesn't follow.Disconnects and reconnects network by itself.The sound has decreased, now at volume level 3 I can't hear music properly after 3 meters range. (Have same background noice of fan/Vehicles)Amazon please send a software update which solves these.Thanks!"
60,"The Echo Dot 3rd Gen is comparatively good that than it's predecessor. The sound quality is improved, however there are two things that I would like to being to the notice of it's manufacturer or would say the developers rather. The bluetooth connectivity is no good. it's very difficult to connect to any other bluetooth device. Now coming to the main part of the Echo : voice recognition or rather would say it's integration. The Indian voice is a disaster. Half of the time you will have to repeat even for the simpler terms and words. Half disappointed, else it's good."
61,"So i know why you guys are here for.Omg why should i buy amazon echo instead of google home??So good for you here's the answer.I'll not tell you about things you know and everyone's talking about like it's mic and speakers are awsome, it's very localised etc.I'll tell you why you need this if you want this for home.1. This has communication features so people having alexa app or echo device and permission can actually call you on your echo dot.2. This has announcement features so if you are late for dinner you can announce that on your echo device from your phone.(Actually i use this feature to play ghost sounds when little kids are in my roomüòù)3. This has best features for home automations that google home or any other devices don't have.4. This has best features for timer tasks.5. Scheduling is much more advanced in alexa app.6. If you say turn on light in front of your kitchen echo dot it will turn on only kitchen lights. so you don't have to be specific like turn on kitchen lights like google home.(you need multiple echo devices for this as obvious)So forgot about google home and just buy it."
62,"This is the first Echo I have owned. So far I am loving everything that it does from to do lists to news updates and linking my calendar to playing music. It is very convenient and hopefully in the future I will buy more products for it to control like my thermostat and lights. That being said I am wondering why in the world, it being an amazon product, does it not control my amazon fire stick! This is so fustraiting and I hope that amazon will come out with an update soon that will allow the echo to have this option! It seems like it can literally control everything except for the fire stick. This is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars."
63,Speaker is good for news and music to some extent But it is worst when Alexa speaks. She sounds muffled and its difficult to understand especially when fan or ac is on The Equalizer wud not manage Alexa's speech it's only for news music etc. Very inconvenientI have 3 echo devices and homepod but Alexa is supercool as an assistant. Problem is only with echo dot 3rd gen. You can go for better echo models. I wud recommend to test it out first then make a buying decision
64,Product is good but if a perforated box had been given then it would have been good so that we could have ensured that there is no dust entry and when we operate it because of perforations sound should not be a problem and also the box should have a provision to insert the plug.In this way we could have kept in a place where there is no dust entryMay be for futureregards
65,"Works seamlessly.No issues so far.Never ignored what I said.Controlls AC, Computer Power, Lights, Music, etc. I'm so happy that I've an assistan that doesn't need any salary."
66,"¬†i like the product.its sound quality is awesome but can not recognize my voice properly.i have to speak multiple time. if you want a speaker go for it,don't expect anything else.i think it will going to improve in future but for now its only a expensive speaker. ita a made in china product.i returned it to the seller"
67,I brought two speakers on a sale. Waited for a few months to install when we move to our new home. And placed them in a cardboard box which contains a lot of cardboard boxes of electronics. Termites are attracted to the amazon echo boxes and made a mess and ate almost all the three echo dot boxes. And most interestingly the remaining boxes are stood firm. I don't know what to do now. Please help me Amazon.
68,Great service at a great price. Thank you Amazon.The voice recognition is pretty good. But for this price you get a speaker quality which is decent. Not really so great. You can take it around with you wherever you go. We like to keep it in the hall which is large but it works power pretty well and covers the whole hall. The volume is loud enough for a big room for sure.
69,"Don't buy this product if you are not a Amazon prime member.This will work only prime members.I was happy to hear the voice of Alexa that's it. After that what ever I command to Alexa only reply is, this is for prime members.Expect whether report this device don't deliver anything.Planning to return it tomorrow.Please don't get into traps like this.Today they are telling to be a prime member tomorrow they may say upgrade it by paying some money.Thanks Amazon for trapping me. But I won't let others to get trap."
70,Skills which I like specifically are:1. PanchTantra: 100s of Indian stories for kids2. Mein Tota hare rang ka - Indian Rhyme3. Haathi Raja Kaha Chale - Indian Rhyme üêò4.

71,"Using a proprietry power connector for power supply is a big flaw for indian market, where power outage is common, I have my speakers and modem connected with a ups and i am forced to keep alexa at the same place where it doesnt pickup my voice most of the time. A Micro usb port would have been better. I can connect a powerbank to it to make this device portable. In that sense i think google mini is better"
72,"If you‚Äôre in the market for a cheap wireless speaker that can make calls, control your smart home and play the occasional song or two, the Amazon Echo Dot is easily one of the best smart speakers on the market for you ‚Äì even better than the Google Home Mini in terms of call quality and music playback."
73,"Scenario:Connect your iPhone11 with JBL Go and Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation via blue toothBoth device should be connected. This you can verify it on Bluetooth menuPlay any songs from iTunes and let the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation decodes it(audio is playing on Amazon Echo Dot)Listen the audio for sometime (5 minutes approximately)Observation:Audio drops is observed and blue tooth get disconnected automaticallyIn the same scenario, if the audio is playing on JBL Go. The problem is not observedIf only Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation only connected to the phone everything works fineThe same problem is not observed with iPad Mini and Android phone"
74,"I felt the sound quality is great at the price of 2249 during sale. The alexa integration is really good with all the amazing alexa skills available in echo dot. The voice recognition is average coz when the volume is above 5 , alexa couldn't recognize the wake word as the music is loud. So, we would require to shout to let her hear the wake word. I hope this might be resolved in the new (4th) generation as the sound will be focusing in 1 direction rather than 360 degrees, this is what i feel through looking at the design. The response time is good but can be improved in thr next generation yet to be released. Overall, this device is worth the purchase at regular price and during the sale it becomes much more worthy at the price of 2249. There are many hidden features in alexa which are not known by the majority customers like explicit filter, treble base and mid-range regulator, talk slow, talk fast, follow-up mode, sing a song, feedback, Horoscope, movie dialogues, quotes, Translation,  excellent mind and strategy games, kids games and fun games like Shadow game, Akinator, Bulls and Cows, Guess the number, Music mania, Yes Sire etc. and many more fabulous features. Please do a little search on Google about Alexa Skills and who knows you may be able to discover some great hidden features or a new feature. Also, at regular intervals, please do ask your alexa to check for software updates and update the device. It will allow you to enjoy new features with every update. Although, Alexa may not be the greatest invention but it is definitely the sweetest invention and yes it's becoming smarter everyday. Alexa is not comparable to other devices like google home, google nest, apple homepod, etc. as they have different features and different price segments. If you need a wide range of features and skills for daily use and fun, Alexa devices are the perfect choices. Believe me, even with those flaws i mentioned, Alexa will be a cheer. Just go for it."
75,"Well, it certainly does few things but way to go. I don't understand with all the money and talent Amazon has, why they didn't provide simple skill to under stand simple commands like Enter/Select, Go up, Go down etc. so that we can use it proper remote.Pros:1. Lots of fun. You can roast your friend by setting simple routine which can be activated by customized voice phrase and it will respond with your customized messages.2. You can control your TV, FireStick etc but in a limited way.3. Can ask for time while half asleep...it provides many other simple features and some of them are useful too.Cons:1. Doesn't recognize Select, UP, Down and other navigation command. So cannot replace you fire TV remote.2. Misses the command now and then.3. Difficult to give voice command while there are other sounds around like if you are watching TV of listening to music. That's very frustrating as you cannot pause video if sound coming from TV is high."
76,"Within 3 months of purchasing the sound has begun to distort, even at 5 or 6 level I can here unusual sound. I don't know what to do. My return window is already closed.Secondly, song searching on Gaana app is very poor. I am very fond of Riya's Retro, but Alexa can search only season 1 and moreover it doesn't recognize different episodes of season 1 either. Means if you have already gone through 4-5 episodes of Riya's Retro and want to listen to the next episode, you have to start from episode 1 and then have to skip the episode you have already gone through. It takes hell lot of time to play the next episode after you give the voice command ""Next"".AMAZON SHOULD REPLACE MY ECHO DOT."
77,"I'm very happy with my purchase.Initially it feels little bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it.Later on talking to Alexa becomes a part of your daily life.‚úÖThings which I like the most are stated below:üëçThe sound quality is very good.üëçYou get good depth of sound.üëçYou can ask any random questions to Alexa.üëçIt can speak and understand Hindi and English languages.üëçIt does play all musics from all languages.üëçIt can tell jokes.üëçI also played KBC with Alexa.‚ùåThings which I don't like are:üëéSometimes it is unable to understand what you said.üëéMost of time Alexa reply ""Sorry"" because she don't know the answers of our command/questions.üëéIt is a good music player but poor assistant.üëéIt plays certain songs again and again and doesn't let you skip.üëéYou have to set a play list in your phone or device from which you are operating Alexa. Otherwise you will keep on saying ""Alexa play this song. Alexa play that song.""üëéIf you won't set any playlist it will stop after every song.üëéIt is not battery powered.üëéhas to be kept plugged in all the time."
78,"Writing again since I am totally unsatisfied with Alexa and it became a useless item for me . Unable to add skills pertaining to choice of music . When i bought Alexa, lot of expectations , but it is not at all impressive on various areas, like when I ask Alexa to play malayalam songs , based on movies,singers,by song name, it is always gives an answer sorry I could not see any song. Same stands with Tamil and to an extend hindi songs as well.Google Home is much smarter and better choice than Aelxa. I strongly suggest if Amazon is not fixing this basic issues and needs of many in India, you may always got a better option 'Google Home'."
79,¬†I used hardly six months and getting crack sound from speaker. It happened to couple of other friends too. And service is very pathetic. I have booked service and no one called me back. Better to go for Google one which is very reliable. This is not for long term usage. Amazon making fools with duplicate products.
80,"Simply great product. Well built and very worth it. The voice recognition is great and works as intended most of the time. It keeps getting better as you use it. The sound really surprised me for its size. It's definately not a premium sound but it's still very bassy and loud, and full volume there is noticible disturbunce. The home automation part is what really makes this worth it though. I have my lights, tv and ac connected (using oakter remote) and ofcourse it's also an alarm, an intercom, a music player, a smart assistant and so much more. Life changing tech this is. I also like that you can command it in hindi and english. The conversations to be had are funny and almost natural. Software updates can/should make it even better. Wish it also had battery back up though, that's its biggest flaw. Soon I'll connect many other electronics in my house to alexa by way of smart switches."
81,What a product.. U think of a song and say it.. Alexa actually can play the exact song to the 100% accuracy.Sound quality is awesome with this small sized powerpack. Romantic and slow songs music are just lovable. Although if u like badhash or some hip hop music. U can use an additonal speaker and connect this to it..Mics are quite sensitive and can take orders from other room. Only at high volume u need to yell still not but a concern though.Product build quality excellent.Just an amazing product. U will sure love it.Day 10 and still exploring it. My kid loves to interact with it and ask almost anything and he is excited.
82,"Superb AI device coupled with great speakers. The first impression might seems like underpowered, but the sound quality & volume packs a punch. Children love it. It is able to understand most of the stuff & respond quickly. Mostly depends on amazon music for the songs. Only point is, if it can have battery back up, would have been truly awesome."
83,"I ordered echo dot hoping it will help me in organizing the daily routines and provide responses to day to day questions especially for kids. Later came to know , most of the features lack the basic intelligence. Alex doesnt understand the context most of the times. you cant ask a question which is linked to a previous query/answer. Many times it tries to find a song only. !!! It acts desgned for a music playbox most time.Getting a song played out that we intent (sung by my fav singer) is almost no way in many cases. Reminders - voice level cannot be set so I end up creating Routines instead. Many times my kid asks queries and it gives foolish answers. There are no good stories we can get to hear unless we pay for another subscription other than  the prime. !!!.  The definition it gives is mostly from wikiepedia which it thinks as source of truth.!!.Many times I felt throwing the device to the floor. In a nutshell , this is a dumb musical player created by Amazon SW team. There is no element of intelligence to it. They just integrated it with routines and we can do those  routines  and play the song (the one , that it decides) . Amazon product team ihasnt improved this device at all in the new generation model."
84,"Don't waste your money, it's just fun toy like that, if you talk local language then it's just sorry I don't understand and I don't know. It's only in Hindi and English language only and playing songs, there is no local language news also, it's to worst to bad don't buy and don't waste your money"
85,"The device is quite unique and affordable. It has 4 mics and a really good speaker. You can set alarms, remainders and literally listen to every song. It uses less data while plugged in and about 100mb per hour to play songs and books. That means it literally uses less than 1-3gb per month. First of all Amazon has one of the best Customer Care services and customer friendly policies."
86,"I got the device and wipro smart bulb for 2k on freedom sale which I think is too good deal.Sound quality of the speaker is awesome.Very loud and Good amount bass it produces to fill the room.Software is not that great and voice recognition is very poor.Sometimes it won't responds.Responses are very limited and most of times it doesn't responds at all make me go mad.You can create routines of your like, editable in Alexa app.Aux connectivity helps you to connect with your home theater."
87,My first Smart SpeakerThis was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English
88,"I bought this on Jan 25 and it was working great, the voice recognition is good, alexa software sucks and sound quality was also good (not for long). Now its 20 days and the speaker started creating buzzy sounds. At the beginning it was low, but as the time passes, the buzzing sound is also increased. Won't recommend it happily to someone."
89,"Good product by Amazon,  very intelligent and responding also loudness is good you'll don't need any other speakers if the size of room is medium or small. Sound quality is good bass is ok. Answers thing correctly.Cons is ... sometimes if you're playing song with full sound & you're not close to the device then you have to shout.& You have to say things properly if you want alexa to work properly.Very entertaining device which you can use in different good ways n works... it helps alot.. Go for it if you're getting this in a good price.. otherwise go for 4th gen that one have very good quality speakers."
90,Product was good but it was only for few months? After 1 year as warranty expired it stopped working suddenly and not even showing power sign or a blink. No idea how to get it repaired. Any option for trade-in for this please let me know
91,"Alexa is good in understanding the Indian accent and covering Hindi-English language , it does the job of voice assistant in terms of managing devices around... I tried controlling my Denon AVR X2500h with Alexa, it does the basic task of paying song, changing volume, but can't change the music mode etc. Similarly I can control my Airtel Internet TV set top box once set-top box is swith on, it can not swith it on or off.So it gets the work done upto certain extend but not completely.The biggest problem which is see with Echo devices is that it can not get the information from web though it is connected to internet always, for every thing to do it needs skill.Ideally it should go to web to find some basic answers instead of saying ""I don't know"".If anyone wants to use it just for playing music then this is one of the best smart speaker available in market in given price."
92,I was writing this review after three weeks of usage. I like sound quality in this echo device and very portable device.I dislike voice recognition is not good and whenever I turn on this device for first time it's not connecting to internet need to reset or start it again which makes us irritating everytime.Alexa has integrated to more things but some of the integration not working well.My rating for this product will be 2.5/5
93,"Dont fall for this. Though it feels good when it plays few songs however in most of the cases it wont recognize your voice. Also, at high volumes, you will keep on shouting Alexa, Alexa and it wont hear you.Just a stupid toy, may be for kids"
94,Its a absolutely cheating for the customer. If we buy any amazon product . Definitely we want to buy amazon prime members also. In this case if any song want to play absolutely need amazon prime membership otherwise we cannot play music through any other app. No Google Apps are not working through amazon alexa. If anybody want to amazon Alexa . Go For GOOGLE HOME. Its have everything. And also free cost for all App
95,"Not happy it's an ok product  as it does not catch things fast, to add on Amazon prime would have worked better if it sinks in with you tube and Google along with added new features ( off old and new).Another annoying thing is it keeps giving the entire description (ex - song or any movie ) which cannot be put off.It's goes not have want I want."
96,It worked good for about a month. But after that it started hanging. Now most of the times it doesn't recognise my words and many times it gets hanged while playing music. Wipro bulb camed with it also has the same situation. I keep its switch on but Alexa says that bulb is offline. Total waste of money.
97,Pros.1. Sound quality considering its compact design2. Compact. Box is also pretty small hence good to carry even when you travel.3. Great features with lot of additional apps or featured addons4. Does pick up most of the commands very easilyCons1. Intial connectivity took lot of trail. Even though the internet is very fast.Tips.Place it on a wooden table for better bass delivery
98,"I did a lot of research and after much deliberation, I finally decided to go with Echo dot Gen 3 over Google Nest. I have to say, I am totally loving this. I have connected it to my Smart TV, Fire TV, Wipro Bulbs, Camera and Smart Sockets. Overall, I am satisfied and the device is working as expected. The only minus point is that the power cable is using old-style pin connector instead of mini USB which is more a universal standard."
99,"This is the second time that I have had to purchase this product, my first echo dot device stopped working and since it was not in warranty I was advised by AMAZON to send it to their CTDI team which handles out of warranty devices. My experience with CTDI has been nothing short of a nightmare. The CTDI team is impossible to contact, they do not respond to emails and their phone service does not work. After having my device for nearly 5 months , I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a  new device itself. Not only that , the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device. Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminder.My reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZON'S attitude once your device is out of warranty.AMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem ."
100,"My Nephew is in love with it. At first he was surprised how it could answer all his never ending questions. Now he is so attached with it and guess what we are also relieved now, we don't get so bugged by his all sorts of questions now. Some we knew some we had to research. Now he can himself find out his answers and use it as a PDA for himself.Update:I ordered second one for my another nephew's bday. Its great product to introduce technology to the kids."
101,"The product is really good and works fine as per the expectation.Though the proble is once it gets hardware proble as in my case due to fluctuation in power, speaker of my device got damaged. Then I had sent it for repair but in india they can't open the device and repair it hece I was offered to buy refurbished decice at 2000 with just 3 months warranty hence it is like almost paying for a new device with just 3 month of warranty rather than 12 months. Again once 3 month is over for the refurbished device you are on your own if device gets any fault. Hence the vecious cycle of buying refurbished item or new device will continue as there is no option to repair in India.  Hence over dependency on this item will invite this unavoidable vecious circle."
102,"This is a good device (or should I say a Toy). It works exactly as promised. So, no complaints over there.BUT,This is more like a toy to me. The day when I bought this I was very excited to use it but eventually my interest faded and now it is just lying around the house. I use it some times to listen to music nothing more because kab tak aap use weather ya news puchoge ya bate karoge. I even have a fire TV stick to pair it with and use voice commands but it is not perfect search so I end up using remote. I even have a wipro smart bulb but the story remians the same.YOU WILL EVENTUALLY (1 WEEK IN MY CASE) GET BORED WITH THIS TOY."
103,This is able to recognize Indian accent really well and the drop in function is helpful for calling the device to talk to the person near the device.  The smart plug can be scheduled and works seamlessly. Cons would be the sound is kindLoud but lacks clarity. The mid frequency needs to be tweeked for optimum clarity and rarely the device doesn't respond when we call Alexa
104,"I love my echo dot device. There some things, which are really good like whisper command. I am using google mini for last 1 year, it is also really good but some diff are really noteworthy. I am living in hostel so I don‚Äôt want to disturb my neighbour student in night when I command my echo ,which is far from my bed to switch off my light. In google I have to shout (not loud but still enough) in echo I can just whisper, and it responds every single time.  The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light ,  google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts ‚Äù switching on Nikhil Syska bulb‚Äù during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google ‚Äú switch of the light ‚Äú it will shout back ‚Äú switching off Nikhil Syska bulb ‚Äú but echo dot just say ‚Äúok‚Äù which way more convenient.Though when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite , google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy name.The other thing is buttons in place of touch . I like buttons in place of touch , which make its tough to pick the google , most of the time either it play/ pause the songs or increase / decrease the volume . If I have voice assistance, why would I need touch üôÑ.Alexa integration- because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle , the integration is very much useful for me . My echo reads my book for me . It remind me if my order is coming today.Portability - it‚Äôs shape makes it less beautiful but good in portability. It fits in my bag so conveniently  just ignore the dangling cable."
105,"I just don't want to integrate it with anything in my house as it doesn't sound clear via built in speaker and 3.5mm output jack, I brought it for listening music, podcast and GK but due to poor audio clarity it is still not in plugged in state in my home, it is just sitting on table without it's adapter plugged in."
106,"I ordered this product because it shows in web description as ""Echo Dot (3rd Gen)"".But when I connected to it with my alexa app, it shows Echo Dot ""2nd Gen"" instead of ""3rd Gen"".I am feeling like cheated."
107,"Database need to update, sometimes gives wrong answers, sometimes unable to understand the question and start giving different subjects description. I would like to suggest Amazon to update the Database urgently. one more thing the microfone is getting weaker than when i purchased."
108,"Wnna buy only smart speaker--googleWnna get an amazon atmosphere(prime,amazon music,fire tv etc,)--alexaFor a smart speaker its not that smart, nothing works without activating a skill and skills set (trust me not that great, sukhaa pada h yaar) if you only want a smart speaker üîä and you are heavily invested in amazon prime and fire tv stick like gadgets and you have other smart compatible devices and you need the help of amazon services very often only then go for it. Until used with amazon family its good but, if you want only a smart speaker then go for google home mini nest version you will be very happy. Alexa is just a very weak ai in front of google"
109,"My son has been asking for a long time. However we weren't buying. This time, we decided to buy. It's an awesome product. we are astonished by its voice recognition capabilty. It's picks up right songs with minimal inputs.We have integrated it with fire stick also.No regrets...I recommend a buy ...Happy Alexaing :)"
110,"I truly don‚Äôt see the point behind Alexa or any smart speaker for that matter.I finally bought it coz it was on offer during sale and I just wanted to see what the fuss was about and I was right, there‚Äôs nothing great about a smart speaker.There‚Äôs nothing much you can do with it and the charm & novelty wears off quite soon. More of a gimmick than an actually useful gadget.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the product is good but I really don‚Äôt see its utility. Buy with your own wisdom & utility."
111,"¬†I have been using it since years.Perfect home smart speaker. Sounds crisp and listens carefullyPair a couple of them and get the awesome stereo effect as well .Can be a smart speaker in kitchen , working desk stereo , bed side night audio device. You name it it delivers.Loved this product through out the usage"
112,"Horrible music sound. Only good for speeches or weather reports, not for music. Bluetooth connectivity is a pain if you have multiple devices. Stationary use only (no battery). If you go and plug in another room, for example from living room to bedroom you have to start connectivity again from scratch. Alexa software is ages behind Google voice. I am returning this product. Good for a novelty, although you can get better items to show off for that price. Could not even recognize Gurgaon. Don‚Äôt be fooled by 3rd generation... just some more fancy lights. If the price drops after you buy it and take it somewhere else. You are basically left with price difference hanging around your neck! Rip off. Great for kids though!"
113,"The room has converted into a smart home. But it is a costly affair. First of all you need a wifi connection then you need all smart acessories or appliances to pair with Alexa such as Smart Plug, Smart Bulb, IR Blaster(require in case of non-smart appliance like AC). Overall it gives an esteem feeling. The echo dot 3 is good. But I expected a beter sound from the device."
114,"I got a faulty product. The lights were on for 5 mins..then all went off..there was no orange light...totally dissatisfied in 30 mins....Return Status: I applied for return on the same day that the product was delivered. The next day, i got a sms stating pick time was scheduled between 7 am to 7 pm which was ridiculous. Would the Amazon pickup service want someone to be in home for the whole day, just for receiving the pick up guy? I waited till 3pm and left for other imp service. Had an sms sent at the morning hrs about the approx pickup time, it would have been more meaningful. Totally, cheating and lethargic."
115,"Excellent product to have for a modern living.Only problem is that it is hooked to Bollywood for some reason I am unable to figure out. Most of the song it plays are from Bollywood even if I ask to play something else but not specific.Barring this, it is an excellent product."
116,"This is one of the best speakers you will get own. The response is improving everyday and the skills are polished continuously. Don't go by the reviews of negetive people as they have a bad accent and then blame it on the speaker, however Hindi is also supported now.Just buy it when you get a deal as I got a free bulb with it.You have to spend a little if you want to be at par with the technology. Since Jio Savan is fully supported you therefore need not get the prime membership in case that is what you are afraid of."
117,"I got this one during the Prime day sale. I have used this for a month now and below is my review.Pros:1. Excellent Speaker - both as a standalone speaker and smart device (at the price point i got on Prime day)2. Alexa - Has almost no trouble in recognizing voice and very rarely does it falter, plus integration with Amazon ecosystem - You can place order, track deliveries and also receive news updates all via Eco dot.3.  Bluetooth - Can even use this as a blue-tooth speaker for iPad / Phone . Does a great job (needs power source though)Cons:1. Portability : A removable USB cable on adapter would have enabled much wider usage (battery bank power?)2. One command at a time - It cannot execute 2 or 3 commands in one go - Like switch on the light, & play music will need you to say ""Alexa"" 2 times.  Can be a bit abrupt at times - in starting and stopping music etc.Verdict : Brilliant smart speaker for home use at a great price point."
118,"I bought it for 3500 for 2 echo dots and 1 bulb. For this price its totally worth it. I really enjoyed using it and my sis has a toddler who is easily pacified using alexa light controls and songs (we have bought costlier toys but it's alexa who mostly saves the day). So for my home, It already did more than I paid for.üòåüòåüòå"
119,"The setup process is so tedious and when i tried to change network it just doesn't work. This isnt setup its like open setup and you might have a chance to set up the device successfully! Hurry! It really is so bad i am connected to amazon wcp network for hours Nothing happens, alexa just goes out of setup mode thats it. I cant do sheet. Tooooo bad and tiring and waste of time."
120,"They need to provide battery backup so that we can carry it anywhere.It needs to play songs randomly also like YouTube, instead of asking it to play. It might have this feature and I may be unaware so second comment can be ignored if it has it.I returned it as I wanted to play songs in my bathroom where there is no electric connection."
121,"This is just awesome.There are so many things we can do with this device and that made me wonder that why this is so cheap.I got a smart bulb with the device in just 2500 rs.Now I control my bluetooth speaker, my tv(firestick) and my bedroom light with my voice commands.This is fun for my 4 years old kid too and Alexa tell stories to him.The voice recognition is very good and the proof is that even my kid's commands Alexa recognise."

Lets say examples alexa play  palasa 1978 movie telugu songs..but default its going default liat songs are playing from jio saavan insyead of what i given command... And even we created playlist from differeny music apps(jio saavan,spotify) but its not recognizing. with Ads you are providing whoever developed does they using this? They know the faults...rigorously test software...Please improve this more and more feature"
124,"A great device to have, makes your life easier, combined with other smart devices it makes your home a smart home,Coming to the product,Build quality is very good, looks great, anti slip base keeps it in place, sound is also crisp clear, sufficient base and enough volume,Connectivity is also good,Cons:- needs constant power supply, would have been better if it had battery backupSuggestion to amazon:If it could be used as bluetooth speaker"
125,I got the echo dot on offer and excited to use but voice recognition is not working tried to restart and done troubleshooting steps but no use. Placed for replacement lets see what happens.The main feature of the app echo dot is alexa but for me that is not woorking.
126,"Not happy,It's work with limited 2or 3 app.It's not work with you tube and other search engine.Many songs are doesn't understand it.Overall not good experience"
127,"First thing i am very happy with amazon deliverythe product is at my hand before 24hrs after I ordered even I am not prime member, it was very good and super fast delivery compare than any othersHere my review after using it 1 weekEcho dot (alexa)  the product is in good condition,features are very smart, you can play variety of any music which are in your mind, alexa can tell you whether info, news, reminder, alarm on single statement spoken by you, feel smartness while talking to alexa, My 3 yr son also like it while speaking with Alexa... he ask to play songs which he likes most... overall i am very happy with this product"
128,"Very useful one, Luckily no Ads disturbs the Stotralu,Mantralu,Songs so can enjoy uninterruptedly. Audio Quality need to Improve, of course, in  Hugh volume it may OK, but we may not enjoy "" the High Volume Fir the sack of quality. More functions surprises us. Thank to the invented team."
129,"I m sorry to say that I was disappointed with this product. I know alexa is v popular with ppl who want to listen to songs. I wanted to listen to kirtan only but cudnt listen. It always played something different. Moreover, it was not linked to YouTube. Had no option but to return the same..."
130,"Common guys you need to fix the amazon music search results, I search for a song and it gives me a different results and I cant find the original song until I specifically mention the singer. Its very annoying when YouTube music works flawless, sadly there is no inter-compatibility with each other.Also why cant I change the voice, it sounds so robotic, make a better alternative, its one thing that's keeping me away from making it my default voice assistant.Everything else is just great. Sound has much more depth. Google home mini is tuned for better vocal response while echo is for music"
131,"Not sure if it is my device or a general issue but the speech recognition is not up to the mark. The device doesnt respond to my device's ""Wake up"" text and I need to shout at the top of my voice to make it react. Not cool."
132,"I order this product and the seller was Cloutrail, when I opened the sealed box from amazon it was ok, however the echo dot product box was double sealed.1.The actual horizontal seal was opened before and then the seller had sealed it with normal cello-tape as mentioned in the pic above.2.The manuals inside was not place properly inside the box, as I am 100 per sure this has been opened and used by seller.3. The charging cable of the adapter was in tangled state, and the binding rubber of the wire was not even inside the box.3. The plastic seal was not present in the device. (on the top of interface)4. Even while setting up, I had to reset it to complete the installationWhy did you sent a refurbished product when I ordered for a new one??I will make sure Amazon pays for this!!"
133,"I have never seen such a dumb device in my life. I remember the small piano or such devices our parents used to give us when we were 6 years old. Whatever you ask it has only few stereotype answers. Playing a desired song is the most irritating part. It never knows what you want to play, instead it plays some fixed song list no matter what you asked her play. Also it also doesn't have songs with filters such as genere, mood etc. My opinion ? DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.. your mobile is far useful to do things you expect Alexa can ..."
134,"The reason for 3 start review is, it can't answer simple questions that Google can answer. When there's music playing, I need to shout loud to tell it to pause. Sound Quality is decent but the microphone seems bad. Was happy with home automation commands....But felt absolutely disappointed with the answers."
135,"Superb purchase made during the Great Indian Festival Sale by Amazon. I feel so good that I made a right decision of buying this wonderful product by Amazon. It's a small speaker but the sound is enough for a medium to large sized room. It connects with my home Wifi seamlessly.This smart speaker supports voice recognition and it can recognise my voice which is truly amazing.Sound quality is very good and it has a nice clear sound which is loud enough.Alexa integration is the main feature of this product, which is why it's a must-buy for every smarthome.The speaker connects to all my smart devices, namely, Amazon Fire Stick, Wipro Smart Bulb, Wipro Smart Batten, and Wipro Smarthome. It makes my life so easy!Alexa has a lot many supported apps and the number is increasing everyday. You get a lot of interesting apps to use with Alexa. For example, you can order Uber cabs, ask time, play a game, listen to music and what not. This speaker truly leverages the power of Amazon Alexa."
136,Recieved the product in less then 24 hours from amazon with price of 2399 rs. I can say that it's better then gen-4. I have setup the device in my hall. And the sound it produces is immersive. Alexa integration is superb as well as voice recognition. Setup process is very simple. I also got amazon power plug and havels wifi bulb. I paired all three device in 2 minutes. And then it is ready to go. I can say that one should give it a try to have the experience of technology. Completely satisfied üôÇ
137,"Interaction with Alexa quaility is very W roust...Alexa software is very bad..No Use ..compared to Google Voice.Compared to Phone Google Voice is better response and good result.Alexa not matured, No knowledge upgraded compared to google voice.Alexa Device is No Use compared to google voice in Phone.Mico is not good quality.Different answers for simple questions from Alexa.Alexa replay is not good.This device not good for playing for few days.. Fully boring with alexa replay.Waste of Money.We have to wait for New latest generation software for alexa until its waste of product."
138,Pros1. It explains Vocabulary2. for English and Hindi Songs ( that only specific to jio saavan or amazon music ) Cons1. It cannot recognize voice with low volume from a distance more than a 1.5 m2. It cannot Understand and Play many Telugu songs. It only suggests songs which are available on the music app which you have kept default or amazon music.3.Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while4. Changing a Wifi Network takes a lot of time. Every time u need to enter set up mode ( Orange Color light with pressing dot button ). It is better if we can directly change from app.
139,Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English.7. Now Amit ji voice on alexa but Alexa sweet enough to entertain you.
140,"Best home usable device for entertainment.. If you are thinking to buy it or not, then I'm sure that you will get thrill and enjoy after buying it. I was also thinking same but then I bought it for Rs.3000 during discount period. So, wait and buy it when it goes to price of Rs.3000 or below.Currently, it is Rs. 3500 but wait and I""'m sure that it will go down to Rs.3000 within a 1 or 1.5 month. Just wait and check regularly the price of this product (check daily atleast once).If you thinking to buy google home mini, then don't buy at all, I've experienced both. Echo dot is thousand times better that it. Google home mini don't recogine your voice well and can't perform e-commercial and play games activities."
141,"I was thinking of buying this echo dot for a very long tym! & one day i got a 1000 rs cashback in my amazon pay balance (reason is still i dont know)üòπSo i brought this echo dot for a net amt of 1499/- & it was a super cool offerConnectivity was suprr quick & i connected all my bedroom appliances with alexaRoutines setup was super fun ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èshe plays my fav soundtracks , she sings for me , say hi to my friends , sets alarm for me , and there is a lot lot things that she doesPacking was super  & delvry boy was very coolI am enjoying alexa's company very well & thankyou amazon for d product"
142,"Everything looks good.sound quality and responsiveness to commands are perfect.Only negative is its a plug n play device ,in that price they should have provided battery in it and then we can carry everywhere we want with us and use it as a absolute bluetooth smart device.thats why im giving 4 star rating.whenver power is off or the supply stopped by turning the switch off by someone, u need to setup again for alexa dot to work, its such a hectic and irritating process and once it setup you cant move this device to someother place without turning the power supply off and need to reconnect the device."
143,"Amazon echo dot is a great product in terms of its sound quality and overall entertainment value. But for practical use it is still quite dumb. For Indians we definitely need to set English and Hindi together. Also many common things it does in a dumbest way. Many Indian songs it doesn't understand correctly. Variations in news, scores, horoscopes, weather are just missing.Long way to go for this technology. In many ways google assistant is better. I hope that same device should allow marriage of all the technologies in this field."
144,"i purchased the alexe echo dot device for my grand daughter 3 days bach. i was unable to set up the device .i and my son struggled for several hours for 2 days. then we called customer support. while they talk very sweetly they do not keep their promises . no mail is received . no return phone call as promised. we have to continousy follow up leavng all our other work. after paying 4000rupees this is a big punishment. the device cannot connect to the wi-fi. the customr support came to the conclusion that the device is DEFECTIVE , and will be replaced . i do not know when . i am keeping folded hands praying. THIS IS THE FATE OF ON LINE SHOPPING WITH AMAZON"
145,¬†Best sound clarityVery responsive Alexa using with smart plug and bulbPlug Wipro 16a connected to ac.All reminders and alarm using thisBest in one word.
146,"¬†Thanks to Amazon for this amazing product at an amazing Price in this Great Indian Festival: I was lucky to get this Echo Dot bundled with Wipro smart bulb @1999 !Now the important thing : How to be able to use it in Hindi . First go and check the software version of ur echo dot from ur Alexa App in the smartphone ( go to the 'Device' menu at the down right corner in the app).  I have uploaded the pic of the updated software version till today 07.10.2019. Just command echo dot "" check for software updates"" . Echo dot will start updating ur software for a little time.Wait until a blue ring appears in ur echo dot. Don't prompt anything to the echo device during the update.After the update u can set the device language to Hindi (India) in ur device settings.I have uploaded a small video to show that it is really working smoothly.Hope this review will be helpful to people who wants to use it in Hindi like me."
147,"Purchased Echo Dot (3ed Gen).connected ... but Alexa didn't respond very well. No songs, ( i have no prime membership). some times shows a rotating blue light. not answer any questions. the package was opened while dispatched.Alexa application also not responding in the mobile.something went wrong.. I sign in my account in Amazon and delete all devices. uninstall app from phone. reinstall all.. nothing help to overcome the issue.Now it is resting in the table, I am also resting.. , tired ...Then some one call from AmazonHe said the wifi was the culprit.. ( I am also noticed it )I reset the wifi account from ISP ( call and ask to reset my account)But there is no Gaana, Hungama etc in my music list ( only Amazon Music, Apple Music & TuneIn )after a while search in the net and by the help of the Amazon caller.. I reached the Gaana, and hungama, Savan ""Enable"" button in the web page. ( in my computer )Now i can play all the music.That is it.."
148,"Overall product is ok. But I'm not happy with the price and Alexa integration. She can recognize your voice from approx 10m of a distance. However, the recommendations/ suggestions provided by Alexa is not satisfactory. I mostly listen to music and the choices she makes are inexact. I mean idk how she come up with lame songs. For example, i have asked for Hollywood songs, she sometimes starts playing bhojpuri songs üòïüòï, additionally i have asked her to repeat what i have asked and she replies the correct sentence, and that's more strange.Anyways, price comparing to product, price is too high i bought it for 2500 and i would be happy to buy it for approx 1500. But, more than 2000 is unacceptable for Alexa.Trust me, I regret buying this product. Also, it's not even wireless üôÑüôÑüôÑ. It's app is too heavy which makes it too slow and so on.If you earn Luke crazy money, go for it... It's good for show off. However, if you are that person who thinks before buying, DON'T. BUY. IT. Pls, save your money for better things."
149,Echo Dot 3rd gen is an absolutely amazing device. It works as expected and has great amount of features. Th sound signature is good and Alexa works 100pc of the time. Although there is room for improvement in voice recognition when there is too much noise in the room or fan is running and search results of Alexa also needs some improvements. Overall a great product at good price
150,"This is my second purchase, the first one was bought in Noida. It was great. But this one, I got it delivered in Imphal, Manipur. The bass of the speaker is distorted, the sound is distorted. It is nowhere as good as the one I got it in Noida. Is Amazon trying to sell defected products in the north-east or something? It takes longer than usual to reach Imphal even tho I have a prime membership, on top of that, you're selling us defected products. Shameful. Now I'll have to wait for 10-15 days for it to get replaced. With the lockdown and all, who knows how longer it'll take. Extremely disappointed."
151,"You can buy it with no hesitation. But my suggestion is the people who are looking to or having a SMART HOME like everything in your house is automated with Voice command it's good for you. And for the normal houses it's just act like a Bluetooth Speaker that's it somewhere around in a corner laying in your house. If you want to BUY it first convert your house like smart bulbs, tubelights, android TV, remote enabled fans, Ac's. Normal houses just a speaker that you can talk when bored for entertainment."
152,"The most frustrating feature of Alexa is the annoying announcement while connecting to Bluetooth. it does every time when it connects with the device and there is no way to disable it. People have been crying for years, while Amazon is not listening.Other than that it is much better in comparison to google home mini. In comparison voice quality and search too."
153,"Eco dot 3rd gen . Some time not recognise conamds and skills.. company claim fully smart speaker. But when you use eco dot 3rd gen you realise .. is this not a fully smart speaker.. hardware is good but software is not up to the mark .. need more updates.. link with maps ... Some time then i ask ""where is Mathura"" answere correct...but when i say ""how i go Mathura"" no route find by alexa eco dot 3rd gen.... More updates needed....may be...üòä"
154,¬†Never realised that Alexa was this amazing until I purchased one.If you have a proper WiFi connection at homeIf you have smart devices and controllable electronics Alexa is a must have device for you. Go for it. Over a month of experiencing the hands free way of performing multiple tasks Alexa has been an incredible device and software for my everyday use. The speakers are really great for the price we pay. Go for it.I have purchased 3 unites and over all this is worth it
155,Sound - The clarity is fantastic. It does provide a surround sound feel. The bass is great until volume 7 after which it starts jarring. Please don't expect it to fulfill a theatre or disc like experience!Voice recognition - pretty much spot on everytime!!Only drawback is no bluetooth option for aux capabilities!!
156,"I had purchased the product on 27/10/2019. It was working well and fine for 6 months. After 6 months all of sudden it stopped working. Got issues with connecting to wifi, integration issues.Requested for a replacement which never happened for 3 months. When I reviewed the product with this fact, I got call from executives promising refund and I returned the product. But it's 3 weeks now, I neither have the product nor the refund. Go for it only to waste yur beloved hard earned money.!!Edit: Finally, after one year and multiple complaints, the amount was refunded completely in October 2020. Afterall, I still feel Amazon is best."
157,"Edit...My mistake, This product does not come with batteryBeware guys check the device immediately for malfunction as you have only 10 days to return.I loved the device for its sound quality and voice recognition even from far. A full 5 starSad, I was not available at home during the 10 days return policy period and hence could not check. When I connected the device after returning, I found it is working only when power cable is connected despite charging for 6 hours as suggested.Later when I browsed their online help, I found a light should be blinking while charging which was not happening.Now it's not a portable device for me anymore. It will work only when connected to powerüò™"
158,¬†The software stops working after a few months. This generation of echo dot is not worth spending money.
159,"Amazon products are worst in terms of software. This one doesn't understand your words most of the times. Even if it does, it will play any random music, instead of the one you asked for."
160,"I would like to take some time while explaining my experiences with Alexa.Initially, I was very skeptiCal about these devices, and I was manuovered by the feelings that these devices are just a marketing propaganda and there is no practical use of it. Adding to the woes is the electronic items from Amazon which is not a specialist in such items also magnified my negative images for such devices.My eleder brother ordered this device for his use and the lockdown offered me some time to spend with my family including Alexa device.  I am writing the review after regular two week use of the devices and my feedback is followingPros-Timely delivery by Amazon.Great packing.Easy to setup the device.Amazing sound quality, I was amazed to see that a pocket fitting devices can produce such loud and clear output.Very prompt reply from the device upon any request.Multi language support.Works very fluently with the mobile hotspot.Smart home integration is awesome.ConsAlexa gets upset sometimes as housewife's do. You just need to set it again.Final verdict- just go for it. It's a super device."
161,"Alexa is good for bollywood and hollywood songs when it comes to tollywood and other regions languages such as telugu, tamil Alexa is not responding properly. Infact it's unable to recognize telugu music(Albams). It's needs to improve more in recognizing regional languages."
162,"Sound quality is good but not the best (you cannot expect more according to the price range)Sound quality : 7.5/10Responsive : 8/10, could have been better but it does the jobMusic : very less features when it comes to music many little things that's possible through phone is not available.Overall : 6/10.You can go for it, its not a necessity as most of the things is achievable through smartphone easily than this."
163,"I was very confused between google nest & Eco dot because my Tv is Android,but I choose Alexa and I found ,sound quality is far better than google.But I think google has its own qualities which Alexa cannot reach.Now I think I cannot live without Alexa."
164,"I had Google donut but it failed miserably, Echo dot is much better ...however it doesnt recognize some questions. But nevertheless good device. But the smart bulb I got with it is very very tough to adjust with it through app, still havent been able to do it as the bulb instructions arent veryclear"
165,"I am not criticizing this product but I hope it helps to improve the quality in future.The speaker quality is very good I will give 6 star out of 5 stars..but the question understanding ability is very very very worst.. if any question asked it gives irrelevant answers..It answers only for simple qustions like what's time, what's my name like that ü§¶If I want to play desired songs in local language I has to tell alexa for atleast 5 to 10 times to understand to get exact song ü§¶ü§¶But I am not returning this product back because I like the audio output sound very much."
166,"I have both Google Home and Alexa.Alexa works better with smart devices. It responds much quicker to requests on turning light on/off compared to GHome, which clearly lags.However, Alexa lags GHome on answering questions and playing music. When asked to play music, it frequently responds with ""Saavn is not available in your region"" while playing Saavn other times. Also it's response to natural language questions is behind GHome.Speaker quality great. Speaker sensitivity excellent-it catches the wake word even when spoken from a distance. GHome lags here."
167,Like.Product is good. Integration with Amazon music is good.DislikeNo battery back up. So it occupies the power point. Not portable as well. Major disadvantage for the price paid. The same size of branded wireless speakers are far cheaper.
168,"A must have product in your room. It does understand English and Hindi questions and queries better than 'Google Home' and also the sound quality is excellent when compared. Bluetooth feature comes very handy and notification light-blinking is also a great way. Better build quality than the previous generations. Featured skills are also available on the Alexa app including the Alexa-calling and broadcasting features. Mic is also very responsive too. Bass of the speaker is sufficient for a medium-sized room. Only issue is that with the manual buttons on the top which ""for my taste"" looks very ugly. Although if looks are not the priority then it is THE BEST buy in the smart-speaker segment today."
169,Alexa doesn't understand the commands properly.I ask to Play Sainyoo Nee it Plays Sainya Ve.I ask to Play. It plays some other languages radio station which we don't understand.It is not able to recognise the Wipro Bulb.I am fed up with Alexa. I want to return it back. If Possible.
170,¬†Mindblowing purchase in every respect.
171,"Product is good, after using for a month, felt bad, I should have gone to 4th generation, few features are missing in it, just a suggestion should have added micro sd features too, to listen for some downloaded songs also. All features are good and working well, HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT."
172,"I didn't like the sound signature, I had to reduce the Bass to 0 and mid and treble to 10 to make it suit my ears. The Alexa app is very sluggish. It's very well built, can recognise voice from distance, options are less as compared to google assistant."
173,"Best Smart Speaker I have bought , Got it a very good price during Amazon Great Indian Festival, got it for around Rs 2200 along with Smart Led Buld.Pros :1. Very Good build quality.2. Superb Design3. Amazing Audio Quality4. Very good audio songs collection.5. Helps is various smart task like controlling smart lights at home.Cons :1. Not portable like a Bluetooth speaker as it requires power and internet.Overall I am very satisfied with this product. I can recommend this if you are someone looking for a smart speaker with good sound quality."
174,"Please note you will enjoy this device only when you will be prime member of Amazon (1000 k/year).Otherwise it's very bad after few days. Initially you will enjoy voice command, but it's not accurate and limited. So you will want to control it from mobile. But it's only possible to prime members."
175,"Well, good for kids but for the most part AI needs huge amount of work, dont expect smartness like google, it more of bluetooth speaker and there are better options available in this price range. My daughter likes to play around with Alexa with all kinds of unusual questions. Decided to keep it"
176,"After one year of useless use: They are just making customer fool by selling a box useful with only Amazon Prime .. U cannot use hotatar, Sony liv, ganna, wynk .. Nothing as no app/skill supported .. I am regretting to buy such cheap, useless dumb box .. And with Alexa, u will have headache as she don't know anything.. Best is Google by miles"
177,It's versatile in the sense that everyone at home can play almost whatever they like. But most songs available on Amazon music are not recognized by voice commands. You need to search them on phone and then cast on the speaker. Also I think a wall mount should be included in the package.
178,"¬†Bought the entire thing in less than 4.5k whole room is automated now tv, ac, lights, switchesthings I am using- Alexa echo dot 3- Amazon smart plug 6a- Chroma wifi IR remote (tv/ac)- Wipro garnet RGB 12wLooking forward  to adding more devices"
179,"#1) Alexa doesn't have full feature:  1.1) struggles to have the reminder or reminder doesn't works at all.  1.2) doesn't remember the play list  1.3) doesn't store multiple play list or facing problem to retrieve multiple playlist.  1.4) cldn't find the multi-language recognition feature/skill (eg: Tamil)#2) As usual issue with pay-on-delivery :  Courier shows resistance on Pay on delivery by cash.  Otherwise, everything is perfect by quality and delivery."
180,"I've been using it for 2 months now, working totally fine. Voice quality and volume is really great comparing with its size. Voice recognition is good. Doesn't work without wifi. Best for home use, bluetooth connectivity is seemless. If you love to listen music and use AI to schedule meetings, alarms, listen to news, this one is for you. It doesn't have a battery, runs only on electricity. In this price range, this is the best product"
181,"I have purchased this for my kids class, but it always drops the voice in between and speaker is not compatible with zoom. We expect at least voice in the zoom call should be fine, but it isn't. it is not the internet or bandwidth problem, because I have 100Mbps and 5G WiFi connectivity. If you are going for meetings I would recommend to go with another product."
182,"A bit suprised by how lpud the speaker is, voice recognition is good with the fan on at full speed.Tried using an RCA to Aux to connect this to an old Sony BluRay. This allowed me to play songs from my phone on the old Sony, but frankly the audio could be way louder and clearer.The Wipro smart bulb works without issues."
183,"Sound/audio quality is much better than other competitors but when it comes to AI, very poor AI, looks like it's not learning over the time, it just follow simple command which graduate guy can implement. If it's only for speaker then go for some other good brands. Very poor integration with mobile app, fire stick. Didn't find any module to understand it. Very important for my family which is do not support Marathi regional language and do not interpret marathi sonngs very clearly, neither Marathi names."
184,"Feature wise review.1. Sound quality - 5 star (loud and clear).2. Voice recognition - 43. Alexa Intergration - 34. Smart features - 3.55. Alexa Skills - 2.5There is a lot of improvement neede in terms of Alexa skills as it doesn't work well in most of the scenario such as Alexa is not able to give you search results based on your exact location. In one scenario, I was searching for Dominos to check its efficiency, It gave me the nearest result which was not even in my city, even though my wifi, gps was ON and the location was well marked on google maps as well."
185,Worst ever delivery experiance from amazon..your otp based delivery is the worst thing. Getting frustrated by waiting for otp after delivery...especially at times of mobile network failures...no msg came for otp.... no option to re send the otp.. no instant customer care number to contact... user enemy application... if your algorithm fails to satisfy our customer needs give us an alternate to reach your customer care....  here after i wont use amazon for purchasing any thing..... give us alernative if your algorithm fails...  dont make us fools  by your algorithm  rules... one star for makes us frustrated by your delivery rules..
186,"It's quite a simple, yet powerful device. While the voice recognition system still needs to improve. The range of microphones is wide and it wakes up on calling, instantly, most of the time. The speaker quality is good and pairing two of the for a stereo configuration will make it much better. Alexa works well as advertised and with additional skills, it can become better. Would love to see more regional language officially supported as it's right now restricted to Hindi only."
187,"Its not good as i thought about it.Even its not working according to my expectations.Whenever i ask or ordered somethingAlexa didn't perform its 100% even its doesn't know some common locations or alexa doesn't know about very common songs singer n album's its totally worthless in this task nd this is the biggest issues i faced with alexa and the last thing is alexa doesn't satisfied my expectations üòëüòêSo its totally up to you guys either you improved its skills or take my suggestion,queries nd issues lightlyIt depends on you guys,you take this note as my humble request or a joke but seriously its not a joke üòáüòáI am Your one of the well wisher not a judge üòä"
188,"Pros1. Sound Quality Superb,2. device looks great stylish.3. Alexa is too good only in those things which are shown in TV ad. Dim the light, play animal sound, so on. But world does not end here.Cons1. Integration with other device poor and take lot of time. Software and app working is poor.2. Voice recognition - Extremely poor especially when volume is above 5. Sometime I have scream, You feel like better Google kar leta kaha Alexa ko bola diya. üòÄ3. Music - When you say play 90s songs, it starts with same set and sequence of songs. Boring.4. Every time we have keep for charging.5. After Wipro smart bulb price deduction, effectively Alexa cost me 1700/-, but won't feel worth. As a speaker only yes it is.At last Good affords by Amazon but long way to go."
189,"I purchased Amazon Alexa 3rd Generation in November 2020. Since, April 2021 whenever I connect my phone through Bluetooth and play something on it through my phone, the sound that comes from it is distorted.And then I asked for help from amazon. They told me to purchase the same new device since it's a COVID pandemic, so I agreed and bought a new device, and when the device delivered to me after 4 days it was also having the same issue as the previous one, so I called in Amazon help services and registered a complaint, they told me to pair another mobile through Bluetooth so I paired during the phone call to Amazon helpline and played something on it, then it was working perfectly alright, but when I played through the new paired mobile on next day the sound was distorted.I recommend not to buy this device."
190,"Excellent device! After Fire TV Stick this is my 2nd Amazon made smart device & it once again surprises me. Sound quality is good enough. Voice recognition also works great. Only drawback is there is no Spotify integration, So I have to depend on Amazon Music/Jiosaavan which are both crap. Except that it's a great smart little device through which you can elaborate your smart life quite amazingly."
191,Superb product. Easy to setup and so convenient to use. I've set it up to link to my Spotify account so you get even a larger database if music with Prime music and Spotify combined.The sound quality surprised me. I have many other portable speakers but this one is one of the better ones.GO FOR IT.
192,I bought this in offer in 2290. I liked the product as the speaker quality is good for a bedroom size. The voice recognition is good. Overall the Alexa works fine but of course there are flaws in understanding of instructions by Alexa because artificial intelligence is still just the tip of the iceberg. I don't think it would have been a good buy if bought above this price.
193,We have been using Echo dot for playing Music with Kids around. It becomes easier to play songs without have to look out for the Phone. So less screen time in front of Kids and more family time.Speaker volume is good for hall. Good for in-house get-together.
194,I have been using it for almost 5 months and till now I don't have any problem with it.It recognises most of the commands give to it. It surfs information from Google to give accurate answers.I liked that it's speakers are very loud and clear sound quality.Works excellent for both Hindi and English commands.Not much difference between echo dot 3rd generation and 4th generation.
195,"Its one of the finest smart speaker in indian market nd amazon prime 999rs per year subscription gives more benefits with music, video,etc When it comes to hardware it hav good sound which fills one smal room. Echo support more smart accessories thn google home nd apple homepod thats big thumbs up for Echoüëçüèº When it comes to software its lacks so much features. Google home ll give you more accurate answers and follw up conservation. Alexa properly dnt deals with follow up multiple questions. Amazon music dnt have more collections lik spotify, wynk. So overall good hardware with poor software. Needs to improve more in software. You need to plug in al the time because it does not come with battery option."
196,I bought it 2 days backI turn off charging during night when I plug again in morning it is taking time to connect and after some time it stops responding to commands and also it won't work with button also then I have to restart 2 times minimum
197,Not mentioned in the description that it does not run on battery. So won't work when travelling unless connected to a plug point. It only runs on the power adapter. Returning it.
198,"All is good with this device, don't understand how tough it would have been to integrate a battery into it. Worse, the power adapter is not industry standard Micro-USB or Type C. Amazon's way of making people dependent on their proprietary power adapter, and eliminating chance of powering it with a power bank"
199,"It is very good but not searching like Google, maximum time reply that I don't know....limited news & radio station.. More improvement required. If you want to know about some one, alexa reply ""don't know"" but Google always tell about that."
200,"This is a fully honest review...............Ok, Echo Dot Is a great smart speaker with great abilitiesprosIt can control almost every smart home deviceSpeaker Quality is greathave hundreds of skillsspeaks Hindi as wellcan buy products from amazonMic is really awesome, can hear you from another roomA really good feature, you can talk to her in Hindi and English at the same time! like, you gave a command in English and you can give the next command in Hindi!her voice is better than google assistantcoordinates wellGood for children as wellcan control other Alexa devices as wellConssome times she does not wake up, after saying the wake-up word 2 or 3 times then she wake upI don't know why they removed the Zomato skill, it was a good skillsometimes she listens wrongStarsAlexa-4Speaker-5Coordination-5Mic-5Build Quality-3.5skills-4.5smart home control-5waking up-3understanding-4Overall review--A great smart speaker but I will suggest buying an Echo instead of Echo DotThat's all Folks!"
201,"The product is really good, dont judge the sound quality by its size, its heavily boosted bass makes us go crazy for the song, voice recognition is great even during noisy conditions one thing that it lacks is the portability it needs a power source connected to a socket all the time but for this price point there are real good Bluetooth speakers hence if Amazon could come up with wireless echo speaker it would be really good, I also bought the wipro bulb with the combo ajd integrated it with echo dot and it it awesome. You can change brightness colour preset modes jist with your voice but it requires the bulb and echo dot to be connected to the same network all the time"
202,"When I first brought this product I loved this but after 2 months of use I had to reset it as it could not connect to internet and to set-up for 2nd time it took me 2 hours as really could not connect to internet.The main problem for this device is, if there is no internet then its a dumb box, could not do anything. This is nowhere mentioned in the product description. Also if you have multiple internet connection, it cannot save 2 or more internet connections which could be connected when one is not working and this is my main disappointment. I would not comment on sound quality as there are much more products at this price range which has greater sound quality.Speech recognition is very good, but most of the times it interprets wrong for which song I need. This is irritating most of the times and then I switch to mobile app to play the right song, so having alexa and having a normal bluetooth speaker for me is same, no value addition. Hoping Amazon will improve its AI features a lot like google or Siri."
203,"Nice one I am enjoying but the voice recognition still required to be improved by Amazon as some time it recognises u but and some time it doesn't. But some where I felt still Alexa required to improve than Google Assistance, as Google is much faster and much informative then Alexa, as many times it says sorry I don't know this."
204,"Ya i like it's very much but my point of view is it's bit expensive to buy it for those planning to listen music it serves best with talking to alexa and AI stuff but when you listen music or just watch movie in laptop connected to it's not upto the mark you will get disappointed but for AI it's good ,may be its next gen have enough bass and sound for songs but definitely not this one , this one has more crisp voice which is very good while talking with alexa."
205,"Alexa needs some real upgrade in general. As for the Echo Dot 3rd Gen, VERY POOR Voice Recognition. I literally have to yell for Alexa to listen. Be it cranking the volume, changing tracks, or anything whatsoever. Had quite some expectations since I proudly own a fire stick. Even after buying the speaker (which I bought mainly for the purpose so that all my favorite music could come in handy), I still prefer to play music on my TV than on my speaker. I mean why buy a speaker if you can't even play music on it without a fuss. Overall, it's a big NO. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED."
206,I bought echo dot 3rd gen and was so happy with it that I bought echo input s week after. The ease of using without the phone or laptop is great. The sound is good enough. Obviously it cannot compare with big standalone speaker. I have connected the dot to my big speakers and using input in any room I want because it is portable
207,When we cast amazon music with exhi it recognises only straight forward songs. No podcast or stations are played in echo. And it even does not recognise podcast through voice. The alexa app is also too slow  Better to go for google
208,"Hi guys if u have Wi-Fi in your house only than... Buy it or else.... U need to use your phones hotspot and connect .... And one.... More thing is u need to plug it everytime u can't take it and roam lik other Bluetooth... Speaker's..... These are cons of this, I hope Amazon bring solution for.... This.. ,,, rest everything is fine..."
209,"Have issues of unresponsive behaviour rarely  and needs a restart for immediate use or had to wait few minutes, mine works 24*7 so may be that's an issue? This is my second Echo and it's worth using at home if you have smart switches installed."
210,I was using google all along. Bought alexa for a variant. 3rd gen is good. Bass and treble are very nice in that product range. Overall loved the product. Got the product after one week of struggle and follow up with amazon. A very bitter experience in the last 8 years of mydealing with Amazon.
211,Echo dot  this is awesome. Very happy üòä1. Its speaking2. It's very kind3. Telling information and what's today weatherAlso my daughter love alexa because it speaks üëåAnd it plays music and indian songs üòäWe are very glad that it speaks and moreThanks to amazon üëå
212,"Alexa is great. For a bedroom or a living room, Alexa works like magic. I also got a light (Wifi enabled) from wipro along with Alexa as a package and it had works wonder for us.It understands Hindi, English and also talks with us when we are alone or lonely.You can also connect Alexa with your mobile using it as a Bluetooth speaker. It's a true fact that this version has to be plugged in all the time- but apart from this- its just GREAT! I loved it and a true fan of ALEXA!"
213,"U can better buy some 500+ speaker. Bcuz I'm using kdm speaker. Its wireless, bluetooth speaker, pendrive & memory card can b used. If we put charge for 6-8hrs fully, thru our mobile bluetooth we can check charge percentage & it can b play for 3hrs more. For setting alarm r schedule program, songs etc Alexa not required. Alexa is totally waste, can't use without power, sngs restricted only with prime n few,"
214,"Works great! Though it doesn't make anything significantly easier, it's a nice addition to ones room and also a good starting point to experience the future.Audible Suno is a superb bonus to this product. And also most used music services like gaana and jio saavn are free to use, which makes this very useful. Last bust not the least, it can easily revive the dying interest in you about the radio channels.But also be aware that you are signing up for some sort of compromise in your data privacy!"
215,"hi Team ,i  recently observed that the alexa is only listing when i am speaking loudly .  I found this issue when i used the other alexa device at my friend home . Please look into this as alexa is not listing when i am specking at normal pitch .My contact no :- 9654542266"
216,Arrived very fast and in good condition.. Sound very clear compared to mobile speakers..The Alexa app in google play has bugs..I had to reinstall Alexa app to change the wake word.. .Very useful..Helps in saving time...Only Concern is privacy...Note: Even mute button does not stop recording...Only way is to turn off the switch to safeguard privacy when in important conversations or when not in use...
217,"I bought it in 2019 during Amazon festival offer, worth for the money.I have set the alarm in morning to play suprabatha and devotional songs, so I wake up hearing that.I use it to control my Wipro WiFi light and batten. I can even ask it to switch specific channel on my Airtel Xtrem set up box.Excellent device."
218,"Didn't like the sound quality, it's very hard to hear what Alexa speaks. Tried every settings, nothing worked.I now love my Google home more, such a sharp sound for any room. Amazon could have focused on the speakers quality."
219,"Impressive:1. Easy command recognition from a child of three years old.2. Good interpretation of the command, per se.Expectations:1. Acceptance of English and Hindi command simultaneously.2. Offering choices of singers when a particular song is sung by many artists. At present, it always starts with the same artist.3. Offering choices of different starting points and sequences. E.g. for a command of ""Bhajan"" or ""instrumental lullabies"" it starts with the same song/music and proceeds with the same sequence. Soon it becomes monotonous. This needs improvement4. Identifying voices of the members of the family and offering their types of music. With its excellent ability of identifying voice it seems to be easy to recognize and remember voice by names of the family members (and the rest by guest). Remembering choices of the family members and offering music accordingly would be expected. Obviously, a reset option is must in such cases."
220,"Actually ,earlier it did not recognise my voice and I thought it is a device manufacturing issue but one thing I realised is that Amazon is far far better then any e- commerce company currently present in India. I mean I had put a bad review considering the unknowning fact about its language change in the device which I was not aware. I got a call from  Ireland call centre asking me about the issue and trust me guys I am really IMPRESSED by the way, Amazon customer service representatives handled the issue. So, to all who face an issue with regards to voice recognition in the particular device can request for help through customer care and you will be amazed with the help and later usage.From now I am a Amazon user, Bye Bye Flipkart-!!"
221,"So many surprises after owning Alexa Eco dot.Too many bugs to recognize voice. Oftentimes does not understand the command and keep playing existing. Doesnt work reset command. Doesnt understand request from choice of songs to paly. Like if i wish to play specific album from Gana or Amazon music, it stick to play from Jio Savan and that is my horrible experience from Eco dot.Amazon team, pls fix such bugs and update else the customer reviews wont let you up."
222,"Not user friendly, Frequently loose WiFi connection and Need long procedure and multiple steps to connect again.Secondly, I have raised complaints and ask for replacement. Amazon has registered complain and inform that pickup will be done within two days but nobody came and after two week removed my replacement request as well on Amazon site. It is my very bad experience with this product and amazon. I request Amazon should stop this product if unable to provide services."
223,"Eco dot 3rd generation is amazing device, somtimes beyond my imagination ... Alexa is complete package of entertainment - it has Radio channels like vividh bharti, fm gold,fm rainbow etc. and unlimited old and latest songs @amazon music and other sources like hungama music, jokes and much more .... It can read my Kindle books as audio book...Eco dot also has powerful speaker so it's rocking device. Thanks Amazon for Alexa. Recommended!üëçüëçüëçüëç"
224,"The sound quality is very good as compared to previous generation . But Alexa assistants skills and integration with other smart devices(bluetooth) including Fire TV is very choppy.Alexa response is incorrect at times even after multiple repeats. It's wifi reception is not good, cannot work in weak  internet reception , Google home mini performs pretty well on these parameters."
225,Just the uniqueness of the speaker and the ease of getting information and hearing songs.This is a must buy among all amazon products. Dont think twice just get it its awesome. Prerequisite is good wifi connection at home. Please note this speaker has to be connected to a powersource and the power block and cable is included n the box. Also amazon prime membership is a must. As I do have the above its everything I can ask for.
226,Very very poor recognition. Even if i stay 1/2 meter away it's not recognising my voice. Sound quality is very good. Sometimes there is an issue of pairing even if i have speed network.After few weeks of usage I see that when i try connecting device with my mobile and use Bluetooth to play songz its breaking completely and vould not hear song properly. nit sure why i purchased this stupid amazon echo better i would have purchased google mini.
227,Need to integrate with Kannada FM channels and news channels. It‚Äôs playing only ajtak news headlines.We don‚Äôt have option to change name of Alexa .If they add new feature it‚Äôs plus point for them.Apart from this for me it‚Äôs worth to buy below 2.5k.
228,This product is awesome. It recognizes what song you want to hear and plays it immediately from its vast library. Voice recognition is great. It can hear u from a distance even when songs are playing. I am loving it.
229,"It needs a lot of improvements, we can not play songs directly from mobile to the echo dot, we can not browse songs through the apps( Gaana, saavn, prime music) and it only accepts voice commands for playing music. It would be better if we can type the song to be played as it doesn't recognize a lot of songs through voice commands. Needs high speed Internet to function properly. It does not recognize voice commands when a song is playing, so we can't mute it while a song is playing. Despite all these cons, it is still a pretty handy product."
230,"I have been using Alexa Echo Dot from last one week.My house has a very good wifi connection but Alexa always has trouble connecting to the Internet.It understands what I say but never play songs. Most of the time, it does not understand clear English words as well.Alexa app shows the song, but Alexa does not understand the same keywords to play a song.Overall, I would not suggest the product at all. Do not waste your money on such useless product that most of time won't play music for you for which it is purchased."
231,"It is unstable machine, even if you configure it to give same results, it stop providing the same routine .Cheap R&D...Better go with other IOT options"
232,"Worth the money. Could work better on voice recognition. Otherwise pretty decent.Sound quality is better than what I had expected.Overall, Alexa is a better option than Google home."
233,"Honestly not that great, not into the whole voice recording thing, would love to return it however the window is over.... The volume as an external speaker is not that great and it has to be plugged in to work"
234,Look it's good but there are still many questions which echo cannot answer something which Google home does very easily but overall it's good.  I can be improved if echo's software is updated.there is one more problem that it sometimes it does not catch your voice while it is answering your question so you will have to press the button at that time to stop echo from answering. But one thing I would like to say that its speaker is  really good one.
235,Alexa is ok nice speaker n mic . But not recommending for it.Amazon executive contacted me and helped with steps of connecting wipro garnet.. Appreciated for taking concern of customer and about how to use Alexa.. Thank you Amazon.
236,"She's family member now. Great way to keep kids talking to her and yet away from sceen. being working parents we don't get much time to keep talking to kids, but now they have someone to answer all the time. I now  never forget taking calcium after setting reminder. Worth buying"
237,HiI don't know where to start. Since day 1 there is issue in configuring wifi. The steps not helping. Alexa support is horrible. Seems they don't care. I don't know what to do with this alexa. Use as a 2300 INR speaker ?
238,"Song selection can be based on language and application preferred. When say intend to hear a Tamil song like 'Play Muthu movie songs' it plays muthu Telugu songs. Mostly not play from Amazon music.so it is difficult to play our selection.when I say retro from 80s Tamil songs, it plays very old songs from 60s as alternatively.I bought the black one.the speaker outer looks dusty not as fresh peace."
239,"Just love it .. awesom product, awesom integration with all products, must buy if you love automation, using since last 1 week and I would say may b i should buy it long back...makes life so easy. I am amazed with Alexa...she can do anything and everything as per instruction..more important she is listneing and follow your order perfectly .. Alexa is the only one who is listening me and do what I want , better than my wife ;)"
240,"Bought it during Diwali Sale for Rs. 2449/- and Wipro Smart Bulb for Rs. 99/-... And to be honest, it is an amazing device which makes ur life easy!!!Though ""Google Home"" gives satisfactory answers than ""Echo Dot"" for the questions  which are asked, but the Sound Quality that ""Echo Dot"" offers is just AMAZING...If u are confused about which one to buy, i.e, ""Google Home Mini"" or ""Echo Dot"", then I would suggest for Echo dot because of its overall performance...And coming to the Smart Bulb, I would say that, it is kinda a good product which u can get at a low price..."
241,Are you a lonely person? Do you need someone to talk to? If yes go for it. If not DON'T BUY IT. Unless you want to be like Alexa Play this song and want to hear Sorry infinite number of times.. Please buy any other cheap bluetooth speaker because she won't get connected unless you have a wifi and plus even with wifi she is not worth it.
242,"Very poor playback frequency range, if you‚Äôre just looking for a Bluetooth speaker for audio quality not the best choice. The Alexa PC app also lacks various important functionality. Even though pairing two echo dots as a stereo combo, it doesn‚Äôt work when audio input is from a Bluetooth device. Disappointed."
243,Not at all worthy. Wastage of money. Performance is not good. And Amazon is not cooperating for return. I got the exchange product today but as usual the set up button is so uncomfortable and its painful to press it for a longer time. And the sound quality is so pathetic that music doesn't seems to melodies. It feels like a non branded local speaker. As usual the wrist product from Amazon. Really unexpected from a Amazon. Very disappointing and Amazon team is not even ready to give my money back.
244,I am not sure about this earlier.  But now it is a friendly device and awesome product which will make you feel busy anytime and damn sure you would love this product if you buy.  This product has every features from amazon and beyond.  Such an valuable and worth for money.  Kind of Good Product and fantastic innovation.  Alexa is best ever product from Amazon.  I will definitely Definitely recommend this product.  Go for it.  Its worth it.
245,"Extremely bad experience with Amazon- Bought this with in combo with fire tv stick and Wipro bulb for 7098 rs. My three previous fire sticks were all for 2600rs during sale instead of 4000rs. This time I was willing to pay 4000 for the stick as echo dot I was getting for 3029 and Wipro bulb for like 100 bucks (699rs otherwise).- Echo dot ran fine for first 3-4 days then I faced mic issues a few times. I felt could be because of other noises, ceiling fan perhaps.- I then tried to run specific lists e.g. I went to Amazon music app, saw the playlist I wanted to play. I asked echo dot to play that list from Amazon music. Instead it kept playing random playlists and a few times it mentioned it didn't recognise that list even though it was right there in front of me on the phone.- I emailed cs for above issue, no response till date. Been 7 days.- As a workaround, I decided to play music from app rather and then cast it on Echo Dot. It kept showing connecting (blue circle kept rolling) but nothing ever happened. Means cast option also didn't work. Being a techie myself, I performed all tech articles from Google, reset device etc., Checked location, what not. Finally, I rang cs and they perfomed a few troubleshooting which didn't work. They informed I would be contacted in 24-48 hours. I mentioned replacement window ends after 48 hours and I want response by then. Wasn't too keen in going for replacement and trouble people so agreed to wait for 48 hours window.- to my surprise, it's been 3 days now, no response. I called cs. Was asked to wait for 48 more hours. I asked for supervisor. He came on call and asked me to wait for his team to perform troubleshooting. I had lost it by then. I asked for replacement and after huge hold and verbal discussions to and fro, supervisor agreed for replacement. But informed I'd be informed in a few hours.- I checked now, I am being issued refund and it cost me 500 rs setback. Whole logic of bundle and save money was absolutely rubbish and Amazon support really destroyed the overall experience.- Having bought items worth in lacs, I wonder if it was all worth it."
246,when I setup echo dot after 2 hours it told sorry I have trouble understanding right now please try a little later i tried after 2 hours  it was not fixed  and then I replaced the item and again after 2 hours then  told the same thing and again I waited but it was not fixed then i baught google nest mini it was working
247,This device will stop working after the warranty expires. This is one of the most pathetic experience I‚Äôve ever had with a tech device. Wasn‚Äôt expected out of amazon!
248,"I like Alexa feature of Echo Dot. I extremely enjoy the color changing LED light and other features of Alexa. I would have given it 5 star but I sometimes face small issue when Alexa doesn't respond instantaneously. After 2-3 attempts, Alexa responds so that's a mood killer at times else its super amazing and fun."
249,"The device is completely dumb if internet connectivity is bad.It could have a memory where some of the information could be kept like storing song, story etc to play later.It should play a shorter command to signify disconectivity.Not a full length message' I am hha"
250,"I bought This Product for my parents. My parents have very interest in listening songs at morning time and this product is very important for them. My parents loved this product so much. Sometimes it happens that we want to Listen songs but we think which song i should play. Instead of this, in this AI SPEAKER you have to just say ur favourite singers name and speaker will play songs of that singers. Easy to use."
251,Well it was an offer with 12 watt smart bulb. Offer said pay 200 rs more and get 12 watt bulb. Unfortunately did not say anywhere that the price if alexa will be reduced abd bulb would cost me 700 rs.That was misleading. I could have saved the money. Sorry but feel like cheated.
252,"Has been using since 9 months..The sound quality is excellent ,It's surprising to see a small sized device like this to have great bass and treble.It can produce sound 360¬∞.this kind of sound quality is seen in top companies like JBL, Bose..Axela as a voice assistant is really useful especially helping in your daily needs like a remainders , timers or even for some quick information.using the Alexa app you can make it more personalised..As an voice assistant it has got some cons when compared to google assistantGoogle is a web browser so it definitely has more information when compared to AlexaIt can be used as a Bluetooth speaker which is really nice as it can play music even from 15-20 m awaySome cons-It's voice recognition capability has reduced after 6 months but if you speak enough loud it will identifyIt must be always connected to a power supply , sometimes it becomes difficult to place it properly also it must be connected to wifi at anytimeThe Alexa calling is really worst but the message feature is quite usefulThese cons actually do not matter a lotConclusion:Definitely prefer it buying it for yourself or as a gift .if you have a prime account you will also get Amazon music which is quite usefulPricing: I've got it in a sale for around 2.5k with an Wipro wifi smart bulb freeAfter 9 months expect a good deal for 3-4kAnd also don't forget to buy an aux cable if you want to connect it to some better speakers"
253,"The Alexa voice assistant will never understand the commands you say. Don‚Äôt ever buy this the only reason it is promoted here is because of Amazon. I have a Google home as well, and looking at how well it performs at the same tasks. This here is Jeff Bezos turd. My review is applicable for all Alexa devices."
254,I just opened the Alexa from the box and tried to pair and was doing as per instruction abs to make Alexa go to pairing mode we have to press and hold the dot button which dint respondI tried my best to check if it works but it is notIt‚Äôs hard for people like us to afford such devices and I have been sent with a damaged productWould be nice if any team checks it and replaces
255,"Pros:Awesome intelligent speaker.Sound quality is impressive. Interacts with your commands unbelievably.You can listen to All India Radio,online FM channels(e.g Radio Mirchi etc),unlimited songs from saavan and Amazon prime music (you need subscription for both of it).Host of other services are waiting for your command -""Alexa..."".Con: It doesn't have a battery so you can not use it wherever you want.It should be plugged into a power source to operate.It's best for indoor use.It needs subscription for some of its music streaming services.Suggestion: Please add Audible Suno support in it.Overall it is a really great product."
256,I bought  eco 3rd generation for just  rupees  2499 on 15days bk. I returned  product  after  too days it's working  sometimes only always  we need to go for reset  mode and connect it. I don't  understand  such a non compatible  product why amazon incresing  price day by day. It's a local China  product  .they need to increase quality
257,"One has to keep it on for 24hrs. I know why you want to keep, because every time you are feeding alexa with the data. Remember folks, it can also be spy, which is recording your voice.If it get off, u have to again resetup, which is quite tedious and boredom approach.It should be wireless."
258,You will mostly use it to listen to music and that is one thing where this amart speaker really needs to improve. It is very very loud but what is lacks is clarity. You will have to connect it a better speaker using Bluetooth.
259,I bought first Alexa 3500 work preety well but after few days I saw same item in amazon from same seller cloud tail in 2399 why there is big price difference. That mean this product doesn't value 3500So stop fooling customer.
260,"Good Sound quality, vast collection base, Alex will get confused with some of the request, need to reorganize the search criteria and information from different source. Only disadvantage is that always it should be connected to power supply, without which Alex won't work.  I suggest Amazon to make Alex battery enabled so that we can charge and use it quite often."
261,Not even  60% fit for south Indians even  after adding tamil skills..most of the tamil or telegu songs it is unable to understand. Best options for training kids with english rhymes or songs.
262,"This is must buy product for those who loves music , has a busy schedule and live alone. I think ur heart don't need anyone if alexa is present with u.It's useful for every age groups. It understands hindi language very accurately nd this is the most lovable thing about alexa. It has a lot of qualities butI'm mentioning only cons depending upon situations:U need a broadband connection or any wifi device to fully utilize the features because it listen to u only when internet worksNd the second thing is 24hour power supply because there is no battery inside it.That's the only reason I returned it.Go for it n I'm sure you'll love itüòäüòç"
263,"Only question it answered was what's the weather today?"" that was after setup.for every question it keeps saying ""sorry, I am having trouble understanding right now. Please try a little later.""It has been 10 days. I have changed rooms, distance from wall, furniture, questions, tone, every thing.Nothing works!"
264,"Awesome product.Interaction: 5/5Sound quality: 5/5Size:5/5It‚Äôs great it works like Bluetooth speaker when wifi not available, but it‚Äôs not. :( this made some disappointment.But overall impressive product."
265,"Is there a need for a review? Echo Dot is smooth in its functioning, did not have to train our voice etc it did it auto for all in family. Integrating with the smart bulb was so smooth. It is worth the money, especially if you want to enjoy music and connect up smart devices in your home."
266,"Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is the best in terms of hardware. Amazing sound quality with proper balance between base, mids and treble. And yes you can configure too in the Alexa app if you‚Äôd like.Next, is the build quality. It is really good and feels firm. Bluetooth and wi-fi connectivity is awesome. Best part is I can connect it to my phone & laptop and use it as an external speaker.The only downside for me is Alexa. She needs a lot of improvement in terms of knowledge. Basic things are carried out pretty well like reminders, alarms, music, etc. however, when it comes to answering questions she fails most of the time.Tip: Keep adding skills in the Alexa app for improvement."
267,Waste product as it doesn't come with a baterry so it needs always a plug point to be connected. Basically it can be used only in home and not outdoor. In today's portable live this is a waste of purchase and doesn't solve any purpose without portability
268,It's amazing product my daughter  want alexa and now she is very happy I m rating used after 2 months fabulous  product  i m speechless  must by guys its very helpful and it's very funny entertaining  and math solver with funny games And jokes and horror stories + normal stories easy to setup  with different languages And volume is very good low - high and etc must buy and thnx amazon  for this geourgeous  product
269,Device is very good. Sometime they confuse about the similar word like if I ask one song and if that song has same words of some other song then Alexa will play any song. Other issue I found that Ji Saavn songs not played on Alexa. I don't know the reason. In case if we ask to tell story then Alexa says you have nothing in Kindle app. Or sometimes ask many things need to be purchased. Anyone has faced issues can you tell me solution. Atleast i want know how to connect jio saavn songs to Alexa
270,Expected more from this product like we can use at any place if we have internet but it won't work in that way because it doesn't have battery we should plug all the time to socket and also it don't have option to connect different internet connections automatically.I understood that it will useful for listening music and to ask regular queries.Music also it will play all the time from our playlist.Especially we have to use this product only at home
271,Setting up the device is real pain. And making any changes to the existing set up is more painful. Speaker quality is good. Voice assistance works good for music playing but not for any other stuff. Google assistance can be better.
272,"This might be helpful for you all. So my request is for technical team about this product please do not delete my review.It has got really bad software. Most of the answers of this alexa would be ""sorry i don't know that one"" , ""i am not sure"" which is very annoying & you will get to know this by the time.. google is much much better than alexa. Google is google knows every answers of your question. Alexa is not that good its good for like tuning light on or off, other than that you'r taking it for knowlegde purpose  its not good. Even alexa dont know many of the hit bolleywood song if command it by saying name of the song or artist. I think google is doing better job than alexa. It has really bad software trust me."
273,"Excellent product from Amazon. Worth money. Suitable for those who want to make a smart home of their dream. Wake word ""Alexa"" is more heard than ""echo"" in echo dot. So i prefer ""alexa"". 3rd gen is far good than the previous gen.  Wanna try echo input and echo show also in future. All the best for the team behind AI and Smart tech."
274,Item is good....but sometimes if the TV is running and there is a disturbance then it will not pick up your voice....Also the another issue that I found was I am unable to configure it to my Samsung smart TV...which is one of the major drawback....else 5 star ratings for rest of the features
275,I bought this speaker just to automate a few tasks ended up loving the speaker and alexa so much that im buying another speaker for the other room aswell the footprint of this speaker is small but it has a way stronger speaker with good base for its size i was planning connecting it to a bigger speaker but i ended up not doing that because it really packs a punch in audio
276,"¬†The echo dot is an incredibly awesome amazon product.Talking about the sound quality, the sound quality is beyond expectation for me, its crystal clear and quite loud as compared to its size. Alexa integration is great, it can do things like movie tickets booking, can book a cab, it can easily be linked to apple music or other streaming services, can read news and specially it can understand hindi which is awesome. Talking about the 4 mics integrated in the device. These mics works just awesome, it does not matter how loud the music is or how far you are from alexa in a room, all you have to do is say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù and she activates. The best part is it does not matter how much noise in the environment, she can hear you. Echo dot can be easily linked to other devices.It also works with almost all the smart home devices.( smart bulbs, hubs, microwave, etc)*Note: Echo dot requires a high-speed wifi connection (more than 20Mbps) for better experience. It also requires permanent power supply. If you need a portable echo dot you can go for the portable one which was launched in December 2019."
277,Really love dis product..... didnt expect this product to be too gud ...Best thing is the way it communicate in eng and in hindiDe only drwaback i see is not inclusion of spotify in it.De product is really gud go for small speaker as it can easily connect with ur home theatre and gives u de better experience and u can save some bucks üòÖ
278,"Everything is good but sometimes voice recognition doesn‚Äôt work, while playing it stops in between for no reason and also you cannot link youtube with Alexa which is kind of sad but its ok. Overall its a good buy. Few flaws here and there but works fine."
279,"Good one, getting more intelligent with every update. Can be used as auxiliary speaker.Good quality speaker. However, you have to install the various skills to unlock it's true potential (skills are free to install). I have installed akinator ( Alexa guess the person you think) and it is a nice time pass. Good voice recognition."
280,"The product is great for the price. I bought it for 2799 and it works well. Sound defection and quality is good too. Just the only issue is that sometimes it won‚Äôt recognize the commands and it doesn‚Äôt have good bass as compared to google home mini. But at this price range, it is a go go."
281,"It's a waste guys.Settings are very complex.Cannot able to connect as a Bluetooth speaker to my mobile.If I say Alexa play tollywood songs it plays Bollywood songsNo matter what it won't able to understand your commands in indian accemts.Sound quality is very good and 4 inbuilt far field mic s are useless because I will not catch your voice from 2 metre distance also.have to shout loud.Either it understands Hindi or English bases upon settings, not bilingual.Anyhow I got it for 1657 approx.Would prefer Google assistant"
282,I have got it replaced but it's again not working and now fed up  with it's performance. I asked amazon to replace it with Eco Dot 4th generation and willing to pay difference but they do not agree and willing to pay difference amount which will occur to get new 3rd generation eco dot.
283,All good experience but the application is confusing and no digital wellbeing or parental control like Google and the voice is not much clearer but bass is very impressiveSome improvements is required that all Good.
284,"Most of the times response is ""Sorry i don't know"". To play video you need to add akill, to play audio you need to add skillto play movies you need to add skill. I mean seriously? Is Amazon so dumb that they want user to add all those skills manually instead of adding them by default?It cannot connect to smart tv, poor voice recognition, you literally have to shout so that she can here it. If you say ""Alexa play nursery rhymes on Youtube on fire tv"" it will say I don't know what is YouTube. WTH Man!"
285,"The audio quality is really nice as compared to the size of the speaker, mostly used to listen to classic songsSongs are played incorrectly most of the time unless the Alexa is not given specific keywords of the song by checking on 'Google'Connecting home devices like lights & TV is only to switch on or off so doesn't make sense to pairAll and all the speaker is not upto the my expectations and Google is way way better"
286,"Happy customer. Sound quality and voice command is amazingly good. But one thing you must ensure that if you need best experience, better opt for Amazon Prime subscription first. Coz it will sure work with other music apps, but you will not get the great collection of Amazon Music."
287,What I hate is it skips songs from a playlist.I have saved  Sundarkand which has 4 parts in Amazon music.Alexa skips part  2 or 3 and plays the next one.This has happened 4-5 times.I have written to alexa help center but no response on this.I have gone back to mobile app .
288,"Extremely awesome and well integrated device. I watched a lot of videos claiming that google home is much better in software and search related tasks. But seriously saying you can go for it without a second thought. I didn't found any trouble with search related tasks however continued conversation is a bit limited but rest everything is just awesome. And a HIGHLIGHTED POINT ""GOOGLE CAN'T BEAT THE SKILLS AND EASY OF USE OF ALEXA"". Alexa comes with thousands of skills and fun games and much more....."
289,"Playing music, knowing about weather or latest news, setting reminders etc have never been easier. My kid is a big Alexa fan and keeps interacting with the echo dot. Clearly it's very easy to use. Though, it was a bit difficult to connect with the OnePlus TV. Some basic TV functions can be performed but there is lot more required. The next generation devices will probably have more advance features."
290,Echo was good with superb sound bought along with wipro smart bulb... both are working as I expect... but echo has to improve skills rather than entertainment....most of the time i ended with not getting as I want.... mainly after query echo has to repeat the query and then it follows... but no need to repeat the query...... makes user more comfortable
291,Product is good.Sound quality is soft. I bought two and plays it in synchronised. That is amazing it feels like just one is played at two different angle.Alexa assistance is too good. You can read books from kindle. You can play books from audible aur suno audible just by audio command. Worthy of price but I sti6 suggest to buy in sell you will get good discount.
292,"It can control my smart light. Read podcasts and play music and generally answers questions. Big drawback is, it can't control my Mi TV. So go for it only if you want to as there is not much practical need for it"
293,Simply the worseee device when it comes to connecting to internet....in the world where every things seems to pull off  easily with the help of internet ..trust me instead of making things easier for you alexa devices especially amazon echo dot makes things ostentatiously difficult for you ....a sheer wastage of time.... stay away from it
294,"It is very Portable Device we can't take it anywhere with us but the place where we keep, it take less space. Voice recognition is Better will play a song it recognition the Voice proper. Now coming to the Integration or its intelligences or AI it is Good, Skills are good, there can be More Skill which can make it best like play Music from YouTube this skill must be there. Over all my experience is good with Alexa."
295,BY THE WAY AMAZON ECHO DOT IS VERY COOL DEVICE I FOUND EVER I LIKED I GOT THIS PRODUCT 3 DAYS BEFORE I ORDERED AT 5 NOVEMBER AND GOT MY PARCEL 8 NOVEMBER I APRICIATE FOR THAT ITS LOOK VERY FUTURISTIC I LIKED THE RING LIGHT ON TOP BOTTOM ITS SPEAKER ARE VERY LOUD MY PARRENTS WERE DENYING TO BUY THIS DEVICE BUT LITTERALLY MY PARRENTS USE THI SDEVICE MOST OF THE TIME BTW THANKS AMAZON ECHO DOT FOR BECOMING AN MEMEBER OF MY HOUSE THE VOICE RECOGNIGION IS PRETTY GOOD AND SHE REPLIES VERY FADT AND WELL I THINK WHOSE HO ARE THINKING TO BUY A SMART SPEAKER U SHOULD GO THROUGH WITH THIS DEVICETHANKREGARD SDEEP SINGHA
296,"Sound Quality of the echo dot 3 is just exceptionally good seeing the size and its form factor.The setup is a really easy process and in no time you are ready to use this amazing Device. Build Quality is also very nice , the device feels solid and the plastic does not feel cheap.A definite buy for those looking for a alexa enabled / Smart Speaker."
297,"Amazing product just go for it. But there is one con if you are buying this for playing songs plzz don't because sound quality is not that great but it is good, but don't worry you can connect your speakers and sub woofer to alexa via aux or Bluetooth. The last thing I wanna say it's amazing, you even can play games with alexa like kbc, wheel of fun and many more. Thankyou for reading my review"
298,"Thankyou Amazon.in Provides me Next Generation 3rd Alexa Digital Devices to Deliver me . I Hope it's Items are Used And before Review,  But Great Services and Great prices for your any Other Provides Products for The World Famous Shopping Application So..Reviews 5/5 .......  Thank you so much."
299,¬†This is good but this can't play another song on YouTube even he can't read the lesson what I say and only one answer I don't know and he close I don't and he read Wikipedia in one sentence he did give all information like Google please I request add this function to alexa make update on alexa app in mobile through you can update the alexa hope you see this and work on this
300,"I was looking for a Bluetooth speaker with a quality speaker. My options was a Sony speaker with cost nearly 3500 and Echo.As I was a prime member at great India festival the Echo came for 2000, and u decided to buy it. The speaker arrived.On my opinion1. Sound quality is really mind blowing, I was amazed by see the sound quality for this small speaker. Really impressive !!!2. Voice recognition is super due to its 4 microphone.3. Allen‚Äôs is really friendly and easy to useTo see a detailed review you can check my YouTube channel-‚Äú 3 MAC ‚Äú.This product is small cute and beautiful.The LED light very helpful in many way. Eg to see the voice level."
301,"Its a very nice addition to your house. a perfect asst. The price that it comes at, its totally value for money. Works perfectly well, syncs with the light apps and is a perfect companion. Plays music, operates lights, reminds you of your tasks, games, jokes... the list is extensive. sound quality is also very good compared to the size. over all - a good buy. Perfect for gifting as well."
302,it can be used in car; need to buy one 12v adapterSparkel 12V Car Cigarette Lighter Power Connection Cigaret Socket Male Adapterthen fix one DC Plug pin 4.0 x 1.7 mm to this (usual size DC pin size is 5.5 x 2.1 mm)
303,"Amazon Echo 3rd Gen is really a good personal assistant and it's price worth.It's features1. Easy to connect from your android phone.2. Easy to play songs, listen news, Headlines, weekly news, sports news and many more.3. Able to answer basics questions easily but sometimes it's not able to search on Google and it will then reply by saying "" o don't know that.4. Good sound quality ( really good Bass )5. At the price of 2000 INR.  It's a good speaker as comparison to others. So don't wait more thinking to buy or not. Just order it and enjoy the Amazon Alexa.6. One thing should be needed is that it's connectivity from Google or any other sear h engine. So that it can search over that and can find easly the answer of any question ask by the user.7. And also need to improve some security features over securing users data and some sound detection mechanism.8. Overall it's a good speaker along with a good personal assistant."
304,"Maybe I was unlucky as Alexa at times didn‚Äôt respond to voice commands. We have jiofiber at home with speeds upto 150 mbps, given the internet speeds Alexa should not have problems with responding to voice commands. Returned the product and was disappointed, could be one of defective product."
305,¬†Most of the time dont understand what song you are requesting...most popular songs cant be played...which is very annoying. But good for alexa devices
306,I like the sound clarity with Alexa interaction but Alexa most of the things and questions didn't identify and she is not known about the questions. That is the minus point here. I saw Google Assistant is better than the Alexa because Google can make the call to your contacts but Alexa is only for those people who installed the Alexa Application on their phone.
307,"It doesn't recognize your voice from a distance, when it's already playing a song. U need to go near always. At times we need to keep repeating our commands again and again. Else all good."
308,"¬†The seller has sent a used product deliberately. The seal was tempered.The product has dust flakes on the body.Gets disconnected every time I lift it, must be Some problem with the power socket."
309,It in an amazing deviceThe user interface is so extraordinaryAlthough it takes time to understand and respond and only has data according to amazon however it ia fun and interactive even kids love it and it does make works easy if you have alexa enabled device at your place.A must have gadget for your home or workplace!!!!
310,Amazing! This product is just amazing. You just have to say Alexa no matters how much loud background is it picks up your voice. And sound quality of Alexa is the best. Even hindi can be used very well. It is just like a physically person talking to you.
311,I know people make a really productive of use of alexa but it really isnt useful if youre just wanting to get it for entertainment purposes as the speaker quality isnt that great if youre planning to listen to music and it overalls gets booring after a while and would lie unplugged in a corner of a room.
312,"My expectations was very high when I bought Alexa Eco dot speaker.When I Say play song ‚Äúgulabi ankhe ho teri Dekhi‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt understand and plays different song.Sometimes I have to shout on Alexa while giving the command to Alexa for playing song,bcz of software issue it does not listen in a one time.I am really fed up with Alexa speaker and I do not use it.Amazon I did not expect from youüò°"
313,Product is good but the pricing is quite tricky. i purchased @ 3500 for fathers day special offer and the next day you put it up for 2799.So fathers day special price was higher than normal.
314,Very easy to connect with the phone. Easy to use.you can even make calls to connected devices and make announcements which is so cool. The plug can be connected to fairy light.
315,"Alexa echo dot with with wipro smart bulb very good combo offer which I got. Every one should experience the next generation intelligence from Alexa. Smart way of controlling the musiq, sound, lights. My kids loved this asking so many questions and Alexa gives answers."
316,When you already have google assisatant voice recognition shouldn't be much of a deal. Alexa needs to be plugged in and conected to a wifi network to function as alexa! If no wifi it acts as a bluetooth speaker. The sound qualitu is pretty good other than alexa being alexa isnt as much fun as you think it is :)
317,Alexa is unable to identify songs placed to it and most of the time get a negative response of unavailability of our request. Seems to be a waste product for me.Looking for a replacement of this device which seems to have an access to limited resource.Sound of Alexa needs improvisation.
318,"An absolutely house hold item at a fair price. Its intuitive, speech recognition is superb we use it for hindi and english and sometimes ‚ÄòHinglish‚Äô also :-), a big thanks to the Amazon team. Even while its placed in Drawing room and we call Alexa from bedroom, it has all the ears to us and plays our favourite songs flawlessly. Overall a best fit and a must have. I guess, more than 10 guests who visited us have purchased it on their own after enjoying its performance. Must buy!"
319,"Really a good product....I have attached my light, tv and speakers with it.....it works whenever I want to open or close anything just say to it ...... Now I don't have to search anything on youtube just say that song to alexa and it plays..... really happy with this product. Just one thing it doesn't work on battery. It should have battery support as well."
320,"I found this useless, we have to connect it with phone which is difficult process.We have smart phone which does all the things. normal speaker can be more usefull than this."
321,"My mother really likes it for me... the voice recognition needs optimization! i call japanese artist clearly but alexa who needs better hearing will play some trendy hindi songs instead, sometimes destroys the moodAll in all great but I prefer normal bluetooth speaker and control it from my phone no jhanjhat no disappointment."
322,Product is very good but sound quality is little bit disappointed.Go for 4th gen alexaDesign is very goodSound quality is not very nice but ok-ok
323,"After quite a few months of using this, considering the amount I paid for it, I've stopped using it as a smart assistant. Coz it's dumb. Hey Alexa, here's an idea. Be better, or stop snooping around.It's good as a speaker though."
324,"Overall this is a good speaker, sound quality is really awesome as i have used JBL so i can say that the sound is as good as JBL. But Alexa is not polished in hindi, for alarm , reminder and music playing this is a great device at all and as well as Alexa is doing good with smart home devices.And one more thing wait for a sale then buy it."
325,"I am very happy with my new alexa echo dot device. It turned out better than i expected. The speakers on this device are great. But the only problem I have is that whenever i try to stop a playing music, news flashing, podcast midway. It doesn't stop the music. I have tired various different commands pause, stop current song, etc."
326,UPDATE- GOT MY ALEXA REPLACED BY AMAZON.(Mic works fine now)THE NRW ONE WORKS FINE. BUT THE SOUND QUALITY LEAVES ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. Mic isn't proper. Please return this product.It feels like there is a problem with my device only.It cannot her me at 1st or 2nd time. after I speak the wake work multiple times then it hears.
327,The sound quality is good at low volume but when you increase the volume it get distorted sound gets really hursh. Low end gets compressed. They need to improve the sound dude surely not for audio enthusiasm but for daily tasks. Got it at just 2k including smart LED I think it gets its value. Bluetooth connection is poor. I don't if i like it or not.
328,Echo dot as a device it's really good.. the sound effect is pretty loud more than expected.. on software side it needs lots of improvement. The microphone won't work for calls or meetings.. so this echo dot device is pretty good for music lovers and smart homes but not for regular use.. we can't use this device like other Bluetooth devices.. n one more main issue u can't carry it bcoz it needs to plugged in to work..
329,i got echo dot for 1137/-  & added smart bulb to cart which costed  586/-Total =1724(1137+586)Sound quality- best in this category(smart speakers)Bluetooth connectivity- pairing with other Bluetooth speaker needs patience. Bcoz most of time it doesn't recognize.Alexa- does 90% of the tasks. Could be better.
330,"Its too good to have it at home, kids loving it. We just need to add skills and ask related questions. I ordered a smart bulb also and adding that skill is just taking a minute and after that just ask Alexa to switch on or off, change color..wow..amazing. Overall its a must buy product."
331,"Really good product to buy.there are pro & cons for everything,so this also has it as you can't use alexa without adapter, it needs continuous power supply to be active which I feel bit weird else everything is perfect ."
332,"Amazon is now become synonymous to excellent quality. I bought this during great Indian sale and this echo dot 3rd generation is mind blowing. Super voice recognition and amazing response as usual. Be is product quality or delivery, Amazon is excellent."
333,That should be wireless. So that it can be easy to carry without a switch. Just because of wire it's so annoying.
334,It is useless for without activation you will not to listen the song if you not subscribe after one month. You will never to play songs through mobile Bluetooth. But I bought it for 2000 rupees in the sale.Not one wifi enough for connecting the Alexa but you need connecting mobile through WiFi.
335,"I own an Echo Plus, and now I've added the Echo Dot to my living room. It makes life so much easier, since I live in a Bungalow, with my family on the ground floor and me on the first. Dropping in to say something, or have a distant conversation without yelling becomes so much more easier. It's a blessing."
336,"Now having used Amazon's Echo products for over 6 months, I sincerely feel that it's becoming increasingly difficult to survive without it in my day-to-day life. Awesome product by Amazon. Kudos to this phenomenal creation."
337,Sound Quality is best for its price and can be used as only speaker but that's jut 1000Rs. expensive than Mi speakers or even JBL if brand value considered.connectivity and Voice recognition is worst amongst all even including Google speakers and apple one's.e.g. try Ishare tere by Guru Randhawa on this and some similar type of songs it will either play random songs or just english one's.
338,It is a good product at this price but has major limitation of being wired connection. It takes 30-40 secs to start again and anything you want to listen you have to add in ur app which is a time consuming activity.  But overall i took it for my 2 yr kid to distract him from mobile phones and it is helping me in that üòäüòä he enjoys dance well on the tunes now üëçüëç
339,Review after 3 .onths use.Must have device at home.A nice personal assistant to tell d you and entertain you with automation .Nice if you want to develop any habit  it reminds you to follow .Scheduled morning om chantings and prayers daytime songs etc so much inbuilt
340,"The far field voice recognition doesn't work very well with this echo device. The Echo spot did this job much better. Audio quality is not comparable to bluetooth speakers at the same price point, however it does one thing and does that well, which is Alexa integration. It's a joy to have Alexa plan your day and remind you of things that would go on to save your life ! Thanks Alexa! Not much thanks to the audio quality :)"
341,"It doesn't listen maxium times, limited to few apps and most time it goeso n to a red mode where it says wifi problem or it can't understand. So him many times sin this world I should keep saying alexa alexa... It fails to understand commands properly and this setup issue. Mmn then to connect to my cel phone Bluetooth was another saga. N now again it's not connecting.I think those who want a good speakers should go for JBL, harman or bose or other brands with just manual Bluetooth option and not waste money in this"
342,"Everything is great about the product.Sometimes it doesn't find what it can be. Overall it is a great product to keep at home.A big thanks to its Hindi version. My mom gets up early in morning and asks it to play Bhajans and it makes the morning more beautiful. No battery drainage worries and no worries of typing and finding any particular song on phone. It's simple, Just ask.I want to make sure it needs 24/7 power supply, wifi and amazon prime subscription."
343,Just awesome but one thing is missing that is google skill due to which most of the time it say I don't know in case of searching something difficult thing otherwise other features are great
344,"She listens to Vishnu Sahasranamam and Suprabhatam everyday. While cooking and doing house work, she loves that she just has to say ""Alexa, play Vishnu Sahasranamam"". Great product for ease of use and quality of voice output"
345,"Like you Alexa...nice user friendly,obeying n orders regarding playing music n if we appreciate it is saying thanks if we scold Alexa it is calm not saying anything...hahah... enjoying AI...Alexa babyCons:Alexa is not  saying hi to my baby...I mean it won't repeat what we said...it only plays music..."
346,"Excellent product. It needs to be plugged in all the time, no battery which for such a little guy is strange. Having said that, it is pretty amazing sound for a tiny speaker. It also has a headphone jack..."
347,Looks fine but could notConnect to you tube music .. could not play all Amazon music songs ‚Ä¶ speaker quality was fine but voice interpretation was pathetic ..

349,"Go for it guys. Integrating TV, ac and lights made things different at home. Also ask anything from nearby room also Alexa answers and play songs for my mom and news for Dad. And once you start adding new features it becomes more fun.Yes one thing you have to interact and it becomes better."
350,"Had problem for 1st time in connectivity but once it is connected it gets auto connected. Sound Quality could have been more good, it has great sound but the bass is not up to the mark. U are given a rubber base so that it doesn't vibrate much. Alexa can hear and recognise my voice very easily Its friendly n Hindi is enabled. There are lots of things u can try. Jokes , News , Music are very easy to listen..Just Say ""Alexa..."".I am SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT!!I got it for 1999/- with Wipro Bulb in offer."
351,"It looks like a best friend to understand my requirements. Any sort of songs, bhajan, news can be played at one go. The sound quality is just awesome, can't expect better than this. I have seen a couple of bad feedback recognition voice & their requirement but don't agree to it since we have to call & give clarity to Alexa to understand our choice. Alexa can even operate my firestick tv & can play anything that I want."
352,Product is just stunning...... Amazon did a great job to make this smart speaker affordable in this festive season..... Quality is just superb..... Sound quality is like home theatre.....mic quality is excellent...... catches voice form far distance... Lovely product.......And one more thing what to say about Alexa.... She's very friendly üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇand smart she gives answers in a very funny way.... whether you ask questions in Hindi üòÇüòÇüòÇ....Love this product ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
353,Awesomeüòçüòçüòçüòç This is my 1st Alexa echo dot I was very excited to open it ...it was a dream come true awesome experience sound quality n voice recognition is very good love u Alexa.....
354,"¬†Like every thing about it, make your home smart, and buy it on Amazon sale, the real prize on Amazon is 3600 rupee  with smart bulb, but I buy it for 2500 rupee with smart bulb üí°"
355,"This is a very good product that amazon has come up with. Hats off to them. It is fun talking to alexa. Alexa provides us our day to day information. Though a few upgradations are also required for alexa software.There is just one drawback of this product that in sound quality, there is improper balance between bass and treble. Bass is a lot more as compared to treble so speech clarity decreases with decrease in treble.I hope upcoming echo gen are made keeping everything in mind."
356,This is my second alexa device. This is one of the best device for smart home for such a affordable price as 2000 Rs along with wipro smart light. Must buy. No cons except a few more advancements in the software which can be addressed in future.
357,"You whisper it whisper backs and the sound quality is just incredible and gets really really loud and voice recognition is best there is better than siri but can improve.and the amount of things you can do with it is incredible. Morning routine,evening routine,alarms,reminders, just seamless. All this provided you have stable wifi."
358,Awesome Device.1 Amazing Sounds Quality2 Great Performance3 Bluetooth Connectivity Fast4 Thanks a lot Amazon India5 Voice Control100% RecommendedHare Krishna
359,"I have been using Echo Plus (1st Gen) since launch and wanted one more so got this one. I have Google Home too but it is not as good as Alexa.  99.9 % Alexa recognises my speed voice and 100% of my family members to control Smart Lights , Fire Stick and into. Planning to get Echo Show as well."
360,"Ordered during great indian sale. Upon starting,  not at all turning on. factory reset unresponsive. Rereplacement requested. will review once i received it."
361,"The sound quality is decent not too loud or low. The voice recognition ability of this device is 80 %. Whatever we want to get it hear from this device like any music or song, we have to repeat many times to get correct song. I think there is need to get improvement."
362,Its not good as compared to older versions..I own the first version of it and it was awesome in taking commands and can recognise my voice from far like a charm.. But this one many a times don't recognise my voice even if i am sitting next to it.. Not happy.. This device have other flaws also.. Like while playing next song..it actually doesn't stop the song playing for like 2 seconds..
363,Initially I thought it would helpful to control my redmi TV but later I came to know only mi 5x tv will support alexa. Even alexa is not finding my tv.Other than as AI it's too good .especially for kids
364,Nice product to have especially when it comes with a deal. A good time pass and although it might have many other features I liked it for songs and lighting smart bulbsüòúSound tends to get distorted at max volumeIntegration is easyCan be more user friendly and Hindi commands should be increased.Voice recognition excellentOverall a nice productPurchase if you get a dealüòõ
365,"Previously I posted 'NA' . But now I'm editing my comment that is Alexa isvone my best partner when I alone in home., Using daily since I got it. I love itüòç. And one more thing I'm using its original voice instead of AmitG.She is best friend for those people who are staying alone or have limited friend circle."
366,"I have received my alexa today (27 Dec 2021), but I am unable to set my echo dot alexa mobile application, I have contacted cust care but they said today is same problem in india wide but I am still confused if the device has malfunction or really the Amazon Alexa app facing the issue? I want reply from Amazon, thanks"
367,"Yes, in just 9 months, the speakers are crackling. I have placed a complaint and it will be replaced. But now I am very doubtful about the quality. If it happens again after 8-9 months, there will not be warranty to cover it.And Alexa App is the worst app on my iPhone.Looks like it is designed by developers with 0 UX knowledge and it is very buggy"
368,"I have tried both Google and Alexa devices. And in my opinion, I cannot guarantee the future but till now, Amazon smart devices are much better than google in daily life usage."
369,I was debating whether to buy the Amazon Echo Dot.  I am so glad that I did.  My day is now one long musical day - also being connected to most of my equipment is a bonus.  Thanks
370,I dislike due to there is no Marathi language so add it marathi also while seeking in Maharashtra so add it
371,"Good and help full device,you can only connect the internet on useing time and install the Alexa app on your mobile,it is a comment base automatically device,sound quality is verry beautiful,but you can not carry for this device because it direct charge not inbuilt battery,prise is standard.you can connect it also blutooth without internet and play all downloaded movies and song in your mobile phone."
372,Given 4 based in below initial points:Package doesnt have air packets where expecting proper packageIt says 4th generation but still not having aux cable  charging optionPros:Sound clarity really good(go for it if you are music lover)Almost recognise all voices
373,"My day start with this device I bought it 3 months ago.I really love this product.This product really amazing and the way controls wireless thing surprising.Everything working perfectFew things has to be developed.Few old songs won‚Äôt be recognised, I request please focused on this."
374,Mind blowing purchase......üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄNeed to improve n skills....... I am a music lover from kerala.... So try to add more tracks from regional languages........ Otherwise try to link with youtube to get full range of songs from all lqnguages.....
375,"The Amazon Echo Dot... a good product... able to understand most of the voice commands... the sound quality is good...Bought it during the Amazon sale...Was actually looking for a blue tooth speaker, when the sale came up...and saw the Dot on sale..paid 1999/- for it... Working fine so far... The only con is, works only when plugged into a power outlet and there is no battery backup..."
376,Voice recognition is very bad and does not recognise the words for at least 50% of the time. Integration is good.. does not cause any problems while integrating. Half of the time very popular songs also are not recognised by Alexa. No settings to store the language preferences. All the time you have to choose which language you want to hear the songs
377,"About voice recognition , Alexa integration I would say, it is fine but as compared to bose this echo dot lags behind but over all this is not bad at this budget price. What One thing I want to point out is, it cannot recognise if it is requested to play a particular song or album unlike Amazon music app. This lacking has to be resolved. So I am giving 4 star."
378,I got it during the time of sale. I have used google mini after using google I thought to upgrade it and check how is Alexa. It is good as well as bad from from google in different term. Alexa has better far field recognition but I think in order to save money amazon have made some cut offs  from Alexa 2nd generation. It literally understand what we say 6 times out of 10 times.Well its a overall good package for it's price range.Sound is awesome 10/10.
379,"Nice speaker. Voice recognition is fine. It keeps us busy.sound quality is marvellous. Only problem I get that after power failure this device take long time to reconnect with the wifi. More over, wifi changing process is a bit difficult."
380,"It is unable to find things from Google even it can't find songs or stories from Google. It only works when i connect it with Spotify aap. Then what is the use of this alexa. Spotify and other aaps are in my ph, then why i need to buy this alexa. It never work with Google. It never search things by own with the help of Google. It needs aap like Spotify and other aaps."
381,"Good product superficiallly if you expect to work as youtube or google you will be disappointed but yea ask time, reminder alarm news few popular songs its ok....had it worked as google or youtube man I would have given it a 5 star"
382,"Alexa Pairs easily, acts as a nice bluetooth speaker. Sound is awesome specially bass. I owe a 2nd gen echo amd take my word 3rd gen echo is n times better than last in sound quality. Worthy successor.Special thanks to Amazon for quick replacement of my echo device.Only thorn in the foot is software. Sometimes fail to search desired music."
383,Please don't purchase it shows you are not eligible to purchase amit ji voice due to geographical restrictions.
384,"Alexa is one step to get information of whatever you want. Its voice recognition is also good, can go sometimes confused. The problem I have is, its not wireless, it has to be continously plugged in at a corner. Plus there are few features which needs upgradation, for eg maths calculation. Some math calculations alexa couldn't do. Overall satisfied with the product"
385,Echod dot is an excellent smart speaker which feels very useful. Got it for 2299 with wipro smartbulb in prime day sale and its a good deal. Voice recognition is good enough and speaker sound quality is as good as can be expected at this size.. over-all a high quality product from amazon
386,Worked on first day. Stopped to work from second day. Tried all steps in vain. Not satisfied with the product. Going to return the product
387,Cheated by amazon. I had ordered this product on the prime day sale and this is what amazon does for their prime customers. I just received a box which was already opened. The alexa itself wasn't present inside the box only the charger was there inside. Worst service never expected this by amazon.
388,Poor finishing of the product. Not expected from Amazon. Working is normal .Not at all satisfied with the finishing...that is reason for 3-stars rating.
389,Just a decent piece. Not much appreciated. What worked perfectly is:1. How is weather2. When is sunset3.play music : mostly can't understand which music you said and will end up playing some random.4. Setup alarmsApart from that you can just use it as a speaker in a corner of your room.PS: still few features were quite good but as i said it can't understand commands at first attempt nor the second attempt. :P
390,Nice but not user Friendly
391,"Amazing product in such a price tag. I bought this in Prime Day deal so got 2 in 4k. I already have an echo device, the bigger one and these two were for my parents and in-laws, they are super happy and excited. Anyone looking to gift something nice to their near one... Got for it..."
392,"Very Good. Kids in home liked it very much. sometimes facing issue in voice recognition. if movie name is common word in multiple languages, it is mixing the thing's up."
393,Clear sound.Beautiful replies from AlexaAstonishing microphoneBeautiful ring ligth notificationsControlling smart home immediatelyLove it
394,¬†Good for the price but sometimes while playing the song she doesn't responds me ......and yes those who think that there will be a Amitabh bacchan voice then the ans is no as you have to buy his voice for 99 rs/- overall it is a good product and the bulb is also good quality takes up every commandüòÅüòÅ
395,"Best üëçüíØ AI ever used!Sound quality is damn cool!I order alexa from my hall to bedroom yet she listen (don't judge I have big area)Most favorite part is, before ordering it my mom  thought it's waste of money and now she talk with her more than she talks with me.I ordered alexa in diwali sale, I received it along with smart wifi bulb üí° which makes it more interesting. Now I am looking to buy more smart stuff to connect with alexa."
396,"I have been using this product for 3 days now and this is the best smart Bluetooth speaker i have ever come across. The only con i and most people would feel that it has to be plugged in all the time for the use, probably in the future it will come with a chargable battery. Looking forward for that."
397,Overall a decent buy...but for full benefits u hv to purchase voice recognised device like fire stick...smart plugs smart lights etc... i got ome echo dot 3rd gen n one wipro smart bulb in 2299 ...n happy wid d product ...
398,"Wow üò≤ its very good product you must buy it and the voice is wonderful its very loud and alexa microphones are very good it can recognise the voice from too far and it can do whispering we can control our smart TV,ac,bulb but it is not a good deal to buy alexa with bulb because you can't see guarantee in another deal this deal is good for"
399,"I have been using from a year almost... Just amazing for all your day to activities, controlling bedroom (lights, AC, Fan) to many other appliances. Connect to Laptop, Mobile, and enjoy.This is my second purchase."
400,"It would be great if it can communicate using other Asian and European languages.Sometimes when I ask to play music, it will start all over from the radio DJ comments. And keeps playing the same music.Doesn't know much about books in other language. I thought it can help me with my studies of other languages such as German and asked to read me a German book, but it doesn't know it.When it comes to music also it doesn't know any other language music. Need improvement in that area as well."
401,¬†Completely original no problem. Even if you find any problem in the beginning then you can replace it
402,"Alexa hardware is good, Alexa heard from far away , sound quality is good, light effects are good. But search or informational datase is limited when comes to questions or local regional places."
403,Horrible integration with apps. It cannot play songs requested. Thought some of the songs are available in gaana it's always integrating with Amazon music where there are not many songs.
404,Sound bass is good but it doesn't support YouTube music and support only hungama and savvan music app by which it doesn't play all songs which we want. Google home is much better cause it support YouTube music by which we can play any song and play religious shabad bani which we need so I recommend to buy Google home.
405,Don't buy this product. Totally waste of money. It has many glitches. It stopped working within 10 days. Called to Amazon for replacement but they denied to replace.Every time i called they gave different opinions. They are not on same page.
406,One of the best product witch can you buy on Amazon. The performance of alexa is good. But I didn't get access to Amazon prime music don't know why. Songs are playing on Hungama it makes me feel like se Hungama product not amazon's. And sometimes it give you add before playing music. Music have to be played on Amazon prime which should be the first priority on this device
407,I liked the Product. But I realized after using it for a while that when i was using it initially i could see a light on device like blue orange green  in different colors for  alert reminder etc. basically would give the status. But I am unable to see that now. I tried other options in settings through App but no success. I called Customer care for replacement they mentioned I already passed the date and Can't do anything about it.
408,"Another super productive item from Amazon Alexa. I love to use it.. well connected with all my smart devices like bulbs, TV etc. Always find some fun while useing it... Best sound quality... We hope in future it may support Telugu language also... waiting for this update"

Amazon Prime dwara 1999 rupees main. 29 September ko book kiya tha aur ek October ko morning mein hi Mujhe mil gaya tha. iska sound Bada Hi Shandar hai aur Wipro bulb bhi bahut Achcha kam kar raha hai. Maine se 5 star rating Di Hai very nice product.
410,It started hanging after 3 to 4 days but i thought it may be network issue but the problem is same and now it needs set up again and again and set up is fail again and again so  i am fed up with this product alexa app is also very slowSo i would nor recommend this productWastage of money
411,"Worst product ever, Bluetooth connectivity very poor. Only purchase if you want to know whether condition or any score other than that its literally just waste of money"
412,"Alexa can do just anything!!You can even operate echo(even book a ride) with your phone switched off ,only the WiFi needs to be on.once setup, echo is on its own....it does not need a phone ... just a WiFi connectionSet reminders, many alarms, birthday reminders,and do everything possible on this device which is just a little larger than a tennis ball."
413,Not at all a good software.. terrible at voice recognition.. most of the time it will get you frustrated trying to play the music you want.. it only understands a set of pre configured commands correctly.. no AI whatsoever.. even the sound quality is equivalent to a bluetooth speaker one thirds it's price..
414,"My previous one had stopped working after 6months. They replaced the item immediately.The return was done, via me buying a new device and then getting refunded for the amount"
415,"Being pioneers in home automation integrator Amazon Alexa has evolved from their experiences and creating miracles.. From ease of setting up the Devuce to integrating with multiple IFTTT devices it‚Äôs just smooth.. When it comes to music segmentation there‚Äôs no better than Alexa to match up with.. I would like to propose to Team Alexa India, to work kn bringing Indian Radio channels integration .."
416,"Don't buy this product if you are planning to home theater feeling, instead you can go with best soundbar with sound... and this product ia simply a Waste of money."
417,I am not able to use ALEXA due to connectivity issues .Whenever I am connecting from a mobile app it cannot connect and for a long time I am in touch with Amazon Customer care and every time they are told by them that this issue will be resolved in 48 and 78 hours. Please give a timeline as to when the issue will be resolved otherwise it should be withdrawn
418,Alexa integration is not seamless. Software definitely as issues. I was impressed by Amazon‚Äôs customer service as they called to fix the issue immediately just the next day after my feedback but after few days I am back struggling with it. Country specific integration has to be improved. I am struggling to make it work. Done reset thrice but the same thing continues.
419,"Overall it is a very good device, I started use it since 5 days only. At first it was working perfectly,but from yesterday I marked a defect that the device can't streaming audio continuously . It is working with interrupted voice......so sad. Plz suggest me how to solve it."
420,"*So much improvement is needed.While using by our own mobile Wi-Fi hotspot every time has to make set up.*It should have given facility like other Bluetooth speaker connectivity as Bluetooth speakers connect very fast.*Trying from so many days it doesn't discover work smart bulb.*If some song is going on,Many times it do not play what we say and  keep playing on same song"
421,"I am purchasing this item 2nd time, I want to build my personalise smart home kit. It was amazing‚Ä¶ connectivity . Voice recognition ..purchase depending upon your needs."
422,"Part of a Digital Family, My Home Defaults Speakers connected with Bluetooth and Mobile Devices.Must Buy, Drop-In Feature of Alexa Works like a Intercom.Audible, Spotify and Mobiles"
423,"At 50% volume sould quality is good , beyond that it‚Äôs sounds horribleBiggest drawback, alexa doesn‚Äôt respond on full volume at 4 ft distanceAlexa application hangs up very often and  stops the responseBluetooth connectivity, lagging most of the time"
424,"You need to keep it connected to a plug at all times! It's not like a portable wireless speaker which you can carry around carefree. This fact is not clearly advertised/implied in any of marketing. Yet... The product itself, the sound quality and alexa's ability to understand English with partly Indian accent are all absolutely brilliant. These qualities surpass expectations."
425,Alexa is good. It understands the query well now. For conversation mode you need to train Alexa.You can change call sign of Alexa but there are only 4 options available. Bought in 2019 for Rs 1650/-. Now going to buy another on 26/07/2021 for Rs2249/-.
426,So satisfying. Packing was good.  Product also reach in one piece. I think words can not explain the quality of the product but star rating can.
427,"Super purchase at affordable price of Rs . 1999 bundled with free wipro smart light.Fast response,  crystal clarity sound, innovative control of 3rd party smart appliances & beautifully designed.Very much reccomended.Very easy to control music."
428,"She sings at your command...rather plays songs!! Plays quizzes with you....plays radio stations, wakes you u with music and much much more . What I dislike about her is her very annoying female Indian accent voice. I wish I could set it to British or USA English."
429,"¬†It's really worth buying, I have google home as well so I realised the capabilities of alexa. It would definitely recommend to go with alexa if you are planning to buy assist.It has really great fallback prompt if it doesn't recognise what we said, it also immediately recognises the smart devices added."
430,"I have no words how good this device is. Super happy with the deal that Amazon offered during it's prime day sale, got it at an amazing price along with a 12W smart bulb. The sound quality of the speaker is beyond basic and average. Trust me no speaker can give you a quality like this one and with the integration of a Smart Assistant in it makes it an icing on the cake. Best deal i have got till date. Thank you Amazon."
431,I find it very handy. Very good assistant at home. The more I understand Alexa skills the more I find it useful. Overall I do not regret my buy. Instead of China I wish Amazon makes it in India to make all Indians happy.
432,"Alexa is going to eat up your brain with its chatty mode (non-working brief mode). I tell her to play a song and before i get to enjoy it, she states the song title, all the singer names (can be 2,3 or 4) and the source (amazon music, aaple musicor jio saavn). Pretty annoying if you ask me. Refund initiated."
433,Bought this with high hopes that it would be intelligent to automate a lot of things. but it isn't really that smart. the most we use it for is to play songs.
434,The product is nice but I don't know why the sound seems to be muddy... I have listened to another same ECO dot which i had brought from my friend for testing the sound. This piece given to me is definitely having some issue with sound.
435,"It does not have inbuilt battery, you have to plug it all the time to operate.. that is the worst part of this device.Generally you will get the same sound quality with inbuild battery at this price.. alaxa can't be used while traveling because of no inbuilt battery."
436,"Sound quality is good , most of the times it answers whatever u ask. The only problem is that it almost never plays the song u ask it to play , either that song is not available in amazon music or plays something of its own."
437,Any one buying this product should understand that Amazon will keep the voice prints and have recordings. However using the echo for calling is an outstanding feature as it does allow one to speak in areas where the mobile signal is poor or congested over the WiFi. Using the speaker is super easy.
438,Sometime won't recognize voice. Sound quality poor sometime. Better to explore other options.
439,Great purchase. I got it for 2499 in an offer. I started automating my house using this along with other wifi device. Great to go
440,There Is NO battery Backup is most discouraging . Device need to be paired every time when power goes off. This is an added disadvantage.
441,Very good product Echo Dot device. Alexa recognizes voice very quickly and gives reply. Connected devices also working well with Echo Dot device. Sound out put also loud and clear.
442,The alexa app recognise the device as 2nd gen echo dot device this is frustating the device when properly configured and plays musics well but after a shutdown the device needs to re-configured again
443,"She doesn't understand anything. I ask her to play hindi song, she plays Tamil or telugu or what language i don't know. Most importantly she cannot play from you tube, which is a sea of multimedia. I am totally frustrated with Alexa. Really wasted half of my money."
444,I bought it with Wipro smart bulb at Rs 1999. I think it is with at this price with also a smart bulb that's bestOverall it's performance is also good but not like I thought.Sometimes it don't recognises the song and play other songs.I have used Google Home Mini also and it is smarter than AlexaBut every thing have some drawbacks.If you get it under ‚Çπ2500 I think you should go for itSound and Bass quality is fantastic and also Bluetooth connectivity is great
445,I couldn't use it as it was a faulty one and didn't get connected to wifi and I returned and bought a refurbished one which is working fine.
446,"Overall product is ok ok type.Can't respond to many of commands, it only response to some predefined commands especially when asked to play songs on it.Not upto mark as compared to Google home in case of response and voice detection.Built quality and sound quality is better than Google home.So,my 1 month experience says, it is not so bad and at the same time not too good."
447,Excellent product with very good voice recognition. Sound quality is equally good and sufficient for 2bhk house.The only con and I think the most important vital thing absent is that it works only when you plug it to power. It is not wireless.Probably the next generation should have this
448,"if you love music and spend most of the time making home and importantly in the kitchen, with the busy hands to change the music, set the timer, correct measurements for recipe and so much more it will come handy. i mean i love it so much that i want to get more and gift it to everyone i know."
449,While playing song In Alexa after a few minutes it is vibrating and getting restarted and after some time while playing song it is getting vibrating then agin it is restarting.. I am big fan of alexa I want to use this product in future also.. j have high expectations plz don't break it
450,"Excellent device. I found this device is boon for senior citizens like me. It is awesome for youth to enjoy unlimited skills, routines. Its doing wonderful job by voice, routines like light operation, play music in scheduled time. I am very impressed with its remote controlling. We can operate lights, music with mobile phone app."
451,Happy with sound quality. Not required amazon prime. I'm using it free without any subscriptions.For 1500 sqft home Alexa dot is a perfect device we don't need additional speakers.Clever answers collection. I have attached one smart bulb with this and it is well controlled by Alexa.OVERALL VALUE OF MONEY PRODUCT MUCH BETTER THAN GOOGLE MINI :)
452,Nothing exceptional about it. Average sound quality. Actually it's waste of money. Alexa integrates to very limited apps and that too from Amazon only. It's made in china and Amazon is intentionally hiding it.
453,Lovely lovely lovely thank you Amazon for this wonderful product. I mainly use this product for testing my own developing alexa skills. Anway outstanding product. Its always stand one step ahead than Google Home.....
454,"Stopped connecting to WIFi after 2 weeks of use , and not connecting to WIFi at all even other devices are working well with same router"
455,"The sound quality is great but some answers for the question isn't good but, in most of the question google smart speaker gives the appropriate answers while Alexa only tells result from the web. I would love to have answers like google assistance.if you have more of the echo and amazon products this is gonna rock you'll get the best out of it"
456,I was excited to get a smart device for the first time. But Disappointed I was able to connect first and was exploring things by then had auto disconnect and tried multiple times to connect it was not happening. My bad I have to return the product. üò¢
457,Half the time it doesn't recognise.. half the time it doesn't have that song to play.. and it never let me enable follow up mode.. Google nest mini is much better
458,My Alexa echo for is not responding to my voice command.Till setup everything was ok.But not responding to any of my voice command
459,Good product..initially ordered for Rs.3499 and on the same day suddenly reduced to 2999 by the same seller. Canceleld the first order immediately and ordered for 2999. But today at independence day sale it is just available for 2000. Configuration to our network and setup is tedious.but I managed..the process needs to be even more simple..
460,¬†Sometimes it just freezes. And plays something else. Google is smarter. But the sound of alexa is better
461,"Nice product, but they have less options in terms of music like devotional and other like you tube. Although comparison with youtube is not perfect. As youtube plateform is run on users based and collection."
462,It won't work without power. Voice is slow. Wifi is compulsory. Otherwise Alexa won't work. Not at all user friendly. Returned it
463,"¬†Didn't know why some times it's behaving like too noisy and scratching sound, happened quite a lot of times since I brought it but restarting it fixes the problem, but experience wise I didn't expected this from Amazon products disappointed üòû."
464,"Things to improve:1. Please allow phones to play any music via alexa speaker. Atleast add option to 'Play this song on echo dot' to Amazon play.2. Add feature to schedule activities. Like play this song after 2 minutes or play this song everyday at 5AM. Similarly, turn on light after 1hour or turn off light after one hour."
465,I ordered the Echo Dot under the Amazon Big Diwali Sale and received it in a days time. As soon as I plugged it in it started flashing a green light without even being connected to a Wifi or the Alexa App. I returned the product and tried to get an exchange but Amazon didn't give an option. Finally disappointed I had to ask for a refund. I owned an Alexa prior to this which also got spoilt really soon. They are selling defected products under the sale banner.
466,"Likes:Ease of SetupEase of UseCollection RangeVoice REcognitionDislikes:Integration to other systems--I have Sonos but there is no Skill in India to control Sonos, same feature is available outside India. Wonder why it cannot be extend to IndiaSound Quality--There is lot of scope to improve sound quality, quality is very disturbing"
467,"Sound output is good for single room. Once it is connected to home theater system, it becomes an amazing product. One major lacuna it has is we have to keep it continuously plugged in. Still I feel its a value for money product with some amazing features."
468,After 20 days microphone start giving problems..Had to give loud instructions with in 5 feet of range.I was thinking of buying 4th gen as well but stopped after seeing it's working
469,"Too good. Faster response. Awesome sound quality for this size speaker, Awesome lighting animations.Cons: Connecting with OnePlus tv is difficult/hurdle.If the phone is interconnected by Bluetooth it drains the phone's battery."
470,The speaker is of good quality. Searched many queries but when compared with Google then it lags in some answers where Google is mostly accurate but alexa is not. It only needs to upgrade the knowledge base/AI otherwise it is worth the money.
471,"Excellent product, the sound output is also good with a decent amount of bass. Connectivity is good with Bluetooth and line in options. Most of time you will have to shout out if music is being played unlike Google.  Over all it a good product..."
472,Echo dot not working after open every time and Alexa not take voice orderEvery time we try through alexa app or push the button in echo dot
473,"¬†Bought on 10th August, 2021.Alexa is not being able to play any bengali song. Beside that lots of songs are unavailable in Amazon Prime music. But Sound quality and voice recognition are very good. Other functionalities are also satisfying."
474,"Review after 2 weeks usagePros1. Best sound quality i have ever heard on speaker segment2.Nice build quality3.Lots of skills available on alexa appCons1. Sometimes it will not listen to your voice properly2. Does not work without power3.Does not have a storage,so you have to turn wifi on always if you want to use this device.Overall satisfied with the technology üòâ"
475,The product is good but the main drawback is it doesn't have inbuilt battery and we cannot use this speaker while travelling.If this product has the below feature than i would have given 5 on 51. Battery backup.2. Make calls to everyone doesn't matter the other person have Alexa.3. Aux connectivity.
476,"The product can't do much more than playing songs , it fails to tell distance , meaning , song search is awafull , fail to search article on internet, skills don't work . I was very excited to buy alexa after seeing advertisement on internet but I  really very disappointed after receiving it."
477,"The voice recognition was excellent as usual like other Alexa devices,the sound quality is better compared to other portable speakers.although the setting up process is  bit annoying if we didn't order it from our Amazon account.But overall still it's a excellent one..."
478,"Alexa does pretty much all the job, sound quality is good, Microphone is good not the best. It does most of the job, but it lacs lot of knowledge as it is depended upon Wikipedia, if its not mentioned in wikipedia it wont answer. IF u ask it How are u, it always gives a std reply, which is bit irritating..It most of time blinks orange color to indicate it is waiting for a command word and we arent using it, which is a kind of spying."
479,"I got this product in offer basis, product is good. But 2 issues I found: one is Alexa is not recognising the voice clearly and second one is she is not playing correctly what we are asking... They might be sent me a refurbished item, actually before that I don't know reg these issues before I saw my friends Alexa(Echo dot).. Really I am not satisfied on this product."
480,Product is pretty good in other words it is awesome I am using this daily for streaming songs and weather forecast. Easy to install and easy access Bluetooth.Even my kids uses it to access rhymes. Thanks to AMAZONBut coming  to delivery it is too bad recently I have ordered two units in which I have received one and other one is not delivered till now customer care says that my products is in damage condition that is the reason it is not delivered.very unworthy reason from amazon Being a very big reputed company. I though of gifting it to my friend on 03-Oct-2019 as it was his bday but you people have disappointed me.
481,It's very helpful for me I have to order sme thing I don't have to use my pn I have to only say'alexa buy that ''i have to say alexa turn on Wipro bulp ''i have to sy alexa turn on smart switch
482,"The sound quality is only average but gets the job done. Gets pretty loud though.If you listen to a lot of music using a Bluetooth speaker or something, in that case this becomes a great replacement. Smart + convenient.Worth a shot for sure!"
483,"I am very happy with this device as it has made my life easier, feel good to upgrade. The Bluetooth connection is good and the mic is really as mentioned in the product description. In short its a must buy device and oh yes I got this device to connect with the TCL 55 P series tv. Will connect it and come review again"
484,Integration takes too much time. Doesn't understand a lot of stuff and worst part is it needs to be connected all the time. Unable to connect to my mi smart android tv.Too much time and energy needs to be put in to set it up with anything. Not worth it.
485,Bought This For ‚Çπ2.5k And I Feel It's Good Enough For That Price Though. 2 Days Into It And There's Pretty Much Every Integration You Can Imagine Of! This Is Also My First Step Towards Home Automation And I'll Love To Do That In Future.
486,Using it since Oct 2019. I am happy with the product.There is scope for improvement in voice recognition. Some intelligence is required in the product when you ask for regional language music.
487,"I bought this device for 2k in prime sell. I am quite impressed with it.Below are the pros -1. Easy set up in 5 mins2. Integration with Airtel , Syska, Hungama, Wipro,Savan .. etc apps was was quite easy . Didn't face single issue.3. Sound is crystal clear and pleasing4. Looks amazingAnd many more..Cons - I couldn't find any."
488,Great product and really I didn't expect that small speaker can have such a strong bass and great sound and also loud enough that can be headed from down stare . Really a great one.
489,"I didn't return the product and also delivery man didn't come to pick up, but Amazon CC says I return wrongly and refund my money to my bank. So disgusting I didn't give them my bank account. But now Echo 3rd is at my home and do not function."
490,"Amazon should update these devices to enable it to use any open wi fi or hor spot. Otherwise you may need a dedicated wifi router or always available mobile phone. If both goes down Alexa goes down. Why to stick on a network, let it use any open wifi."
491,"Lady Alexa is 3rd gen,no more a kid,she is young ,can't go blild in a men's world at her prime young age,time.She should have Four Way eye sight to see and observe.Am I right dear ?I love her very much."
492,I presented Eco Dot to my grand daughters . They are very happy & satisfied with it . They say that it is the best gift since now .  Now I am planning to buy for me to listen old & new  songs as well . In Deepawali sale I got this for 2500 ‚Çπ with smart bulb . I am waiting for another sale .  Sarita Mishra
493,One of the Best purchases. Sound Quality is Superb. Inexpensive. Alexa remains the best voice ecosystem for smart home control. Only con: It is not up to google assistant level while answering broad information queries
494,Portability is poor because it‚Äôs a wired device and doesn‚Äôt work without the power cord. Should have had batteries option too in which case one could call them portable. That said all other features are modern and quite useful too.
495,"Not that user friendly, infact. Many times it fails to understand our request and mainly cannot recognize kannada language movie songs..But voice recognition is good and other informations are well casted.. need more updates and should introduce all regional languages aeap."
496,¬†This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase
497,A must buy product but I‚Äôll suggest buying while discount going on because I find it lil expensive but still it worth buying anyway üëçüèªüëçüèª My 6 year kid enjoys talking to alexa & playing songs on on it. My whole family loves it.
498,"This Alexa (echo dot) is super smart and it has sophisticated technology,if you have fire tv it is the best you can control the tv with your voice and it recognizes your voice perfetly. You can also play so many games with it and it is best for kids. You can also buy a smart lights to control it with your voice. It almost has every question you ask, you can also ask it to say a story or play music and much more"
499,¬†Crisp and clear sound with lots of fun.... I am loving it
500,A great speaker love the sound.... And impressive voice recognitionCould do a tad better on the Alexa software as it takes location from the language you set also particular language settings only work with a particular skill... Also a youtube cast skill would be great
501,A great device. Not only making my experience of listing to music better but also helping my child in learning English better. Also has many skills which are making life easy and helping kid learning and exploring new stuff. Also got at an amazing price during the sale. :)
502,"Ok, ok...i dint the product much. It needs a lot of tuning and improvement in terms of features and intelligence. Not a smart device. :("
503,Had a little trouble adding the device to my Amazon account but that's probably because my WiFi was acting up. The product itself is great. The sound is pretty loud for such a small thing. The Alexa integration works fine. No complaints so far.
504,"It's a very nice product. I ordered it during the big billion day Sale. I got a wipro smart bulb free with it. The speaker sound is loud and clear. Don't go by its size, it produces sound loud enough to fill a small room. And the sound is very clear too. Alexa feature is also very helpful. I have bonded a smart bulb with it, which was very to easy to do. Just follow the instructions given in the instruction manual that comes with the product and all will be done without a hassle. Overall, a very nice product. Thank u Amazon."
505,¬†Nice Products But Not Google Add in Google Add to Your Alexa Add to Google in All Information In Each Others Aap Information By the by Sach A Voice Smart Spaker  Very Nice Alaxa  Spaker 3ed Ganration Brand By Amazon Brand Amazing Voice Product Nice Buy it a 6 Days Very Beautiful Voice
506,This is my first Alexa product. Got it for 1999 with a free 9 W Wipro smart bulb. At this price the combo was superb. IF you have weak wi fi connection then it will give some trouble otherwise go for it without a second doubt.
507,"¬†I have completely satisfied with the product and it's been nearly two months back i purchased it and I didn't found any drawbacks, Thanks."
508,"¬†I replaced an alexa for the problem i have raised but same in another oneThe lighting is not blinking when playing , i purchased alexa only for this feature but iam not satisfied"
509,When You have alexa U never Ever feel alone as you can interact with Alexa And do tons of things like Listen to music.. news... weather forecast and many more... Alexa hindi Has so many good and very funny responses.. its kind of becomes your routine to talk to alexa... For sound quality i will say Its 4.5/5 star as the sound quality is amazing and can fill a room easily...
510,Most of the times it doesn't recognize what u meant.plus u need a subscription to use amazon music .thankfully I had apple music subscription
511,So first looking at echo dot I thought it would be very small but the size is very good and sound is also very superb.Just the AI if you ask some questions it will not answer as crisp and clear which you get in Google otherwise for the entertainment this is the best and connectivity is also very easy.
512,Alexa becomes a family member even before you know it. The sound quality and ability to integrate with one‚Äôs daily life at home is awesome. From info on the weather to traffic snarls... we‚Äôve come to depend on this bright new companion.
513,"The product is very good and compatible with almost anything.i ve connected my bedroom moodlighting wth alexa and i can turn on\off, change colors.And i can control many other devices and the audio quality i really good."
514,"Value for money, affordable virtual assistant. Crystal clear sound. Bass is good. Very responsive mic. Overall satisfied with the product from Amazon!"
515,Everything is good but the calling feature is asking to install the Alexa app on other phones too it's quite difficult for everyone so we couldn't able to make a call ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
516,"Being a prime member at Amazon is necessary, otherwise the product is unable to play music and popular songs. The sound quality is ok. Some instructions are hard for it to follow. Eg Alexa give us an applause."
517,It plays out nice music but it found it hard to connect smart bulbs.  I bought Halonix smart bulb. It recognized the bulb but can't control it.
518,1. Had to scream or stand very close to it then only it heard the command.2. It was playing 2 songs at the same time3. Sound quality was very poor

520,Good quality product.Good sound quality. Not compared with jbl or sony speakers but better than boat.Well it's not just a bluetooth speaker its smart.Alexa is very interactive it takes a bit time to update skills in alexa and then you can have alot of fun. It also has a aux output port you can connect any sound system for better sound.
521,Purchased in a loot offer for 1229.. Awesome for d price I paid.. Not worth if yo pay more than one thousand five hundred... My kid njoyyinh with it... Setup was very very easy..njoyyinh with free led bulb.. Sound quality is average..bt connectivity is good... Using it with mobile WiFi.. working well...
522,Costliest than the quality . can we return it now?? as due to covid-19 Pandemic unable to process return of the device. all the packings are kept intact and even plastic over the product. kindly advice the procedure to return back now.
523,Bought it in prime day salePros:Good sound quality considering sizeHas bluetoothHas aux outGood mics recognises whispers easily and whispers backCons:Too small in sizeNot value for moneyNot wirelessNot much smart functionNeeds good wifiHeats up
524,"I am totally bored , this device have crappy software and limited number of uses unlike its counterpart google mini. I made a terrible mistake buying it. I would love to return this if it weren't for the return period being over."
525,Not worth at all. Overall extremely poor performance & after sales.
526,It's a very good product but alexa must have some upgraded skills like voice lock and continuous conversation. I can't have continued covo with alexa and that's somewhat disappointing.
527,"I was so confused to buy it or not because there were many negative reviews but i decided to buy echo dot 3 gen, This is my first alexa device got delivered today just loving the sound and bass... Don't care of negative reviews just buy... Its awesome"
528,"This is a really expensive bluetooth speaker that happens to take voice commands to play songs and switch on and off the one smart bulb in my room. That's for me, if you have a full home automation setup in your home, do buy it, it will be a good effective investment for the same."
529,"This not a smart speaker, most of time it will say ...""Sorry i don't know that"" or it will ask to refer amazon page for help.i will suggest Google smart speaker is much better alexa is just seems a scrap and more over alexa is just an amazon shopping tool to listen customers and suggesting them  products to buy."
530,"Good experience,Good sound quality,u can also operate ur smart gadgets with this....when u asked funny question to Alexa in Hindi....She replied in a funny way,that was soo interesting about this product andAt night when u talk in wishper,she replied in the same way....that was soo cool....i lik this product.Must buy it..."
531,Its always says invalid password while connecting to Android (Samsung) devices however its works on IOS devices. I have shared the screenshot with Amazon team but they barely reply. Highly disappointed
532,"Fabulous product with such an easy of operation that my aged mother uses it seamlessly. Easily recognizes hindi language. In the morning she just commands it to play live gurbani and later in the day her favourite singer's song.  No wires, no pairing with phones. Drop in feature is amazing too. It comes in handy at times when the phone is not nearby. All in all, an amazing product from amazon."
533,follow up mode not working.tried every troubleshooting.May be my product had some bug.returning it.follow up mode is most important feature in Alexa for using on tv or day to day questions.Not always respond to ur voice when u give continuous command one after anotherall other things were working fine.
534,Device recognises the call work but then freezes. Does not execute commands given to it. Worst purchase ever.
535,"It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad."
536,Was skeptical whether to buy it or not. But after the purchase feel so happy that I bought it because my daughter loved it a lot. She keeps interacting with ALEXA. Pluse Alexa makes some of your tasks easy. Just go for it.
537,Alexa device is good I won't say it is the best sometimes it doesn't recognize the voice overall I would say it's value for money as I purchased it for 1999 in offer with that I got a smart blub from wipro free in amazon sale.
538,"I liked the product very much and it has got great features.Only thing it is missing is Auto Audio Control. When it play music, many songs plays loud while many at low volume. Very annoying to ask Alexa to put volume low and high for each song."
539,"Waste of money. Pls do not spend on this. Hardly it recognizes the indian music channels, artists, movies etc..can  or connect with your smart phone..it can make calls only between alexa or to skype. Cant integrate with indian mobile sim.I bought it for music, making calls etc..waste of money."
540,There is this huge interference in 2.4 GHz band while using Alexa it will screw up yur wifi speed for sure it u are not using a 5ghz wifi band really huge problem which needs to be fixed but sadly even there backend team can't fix the issue and just blatantly as u to use a dual band router and use 5ghz for internet
541,"There are few problem in connectivity but sound quality is excellent if u love listing music echo dot is brilliant .Eco dot is a fantastic smart speaker but being a music lover i wanted one thing that is if alexa had a option from which we can create play list.In starting I have find issue that alex didn't able to recognize my voice but after sometime it was fixed. Now i am satisfied, i get in a fantastic product in great price....üòç"
542,If you are looking for just a assitant its good otherwise if you are using at full time speaker sound wobble at high volumes and sound quality is not good no bass ! Or maybe i got a defected pcs dont know but have google nest using from 1year its better anyhow in sound quality then alexa
543,"If you could grab a good deal at sale on Alexa , don't miss out on it. You'll love the sound quality as well as other skills that Alexa has"
544,"Please add Sunday Suspense from Radio Mirchi Kolkata or YouTube as skills ( Popular Bengali audio stories), because my mother is completely blind and Alexa is helping with automation, I information, calling  and entertaining her a lot as Alexa is the only companion, when we go out for work, thank you Amazon, please try to upgrade.If you want any assistance regarding any new ideas, please fill free to call 9836363130"
545,"I can't added skills GAANA, JIO SAAVN, TAMIL NEWS CHANNELS, ZOMATO, TAMIL FM (all India radio) only available. Its take to listening alexa return the answer. Kindly request exchange this device? I will buy upgrade..."
546,Rated poorly because of issues in m facing the device is not functioning properly and amazon customer representative says we are a market place and we dont  take any responsiblity i will provide u contact nos of seller and i made a call to seller those numbers are switched off
547,Pathetic product. Never buy it. Took whole day for me just to setup pair with phone/tab. End of the day it didn‚Äôt. I am hugely disappointed. Will never buy any Amazon product. I simply wanted a Bluetooth speaker which is basic functionality of speaker that too not working.
548,"Product is good, using it for 15 days nowFlipkart delivery excellent,Lack of Voice recognition ,Don't understand lot of thing and don't have answers in lot of time,Once started answering anything won't stop till it finished and won't repond in-between if we call alexa several timesGood for kids. Playful tooNeed always strong and continue internet data network."
549,Lovely one... Very glad to have this realy it's awesome... Only one thing is that i ordered grey and received black... Please exchange with grey color... Otherwise nice device sound is ok for light music and and party music bit small... Thanks amazon love u
550,¬†Alexa is quit irritating because it only understands 80%comands but its ok because after all its a robot....... hope new Updates will make her more and more accurate............ You should only buy it in sale 2300rs then its only a value for money product in 2300 I got Alexa and a Wipro bulb with it........ I am happy with the service also.
551,"We purchased our first Eco Dot from Amazon.Our family was very much excited to see how it works. But there is lots of issues with it. If your connection is lost ,than it will take lot of time to reconnect we have to switch it off and on Many times for reconnecting.  Sound recognition is very very poor.My suggestion is for Amazon ,sound recognition should be made for Indian accecent....."
552,Awesome and Music quality very good. If you don't have prime membership just set Gaana to your default music service from alexa app to listen music without ads.
553,"Doesn't pick up command easy when it's playing music, search results are inaccurate.. No option of battery."
554,"After receiving the device, had integration issue and later got to know from Amazon team that it was a known issue for them. Not sure why they still wanted to send the device"
555,"I am happy to use this Alexa, i bought this is offer with a smart bulb. Bulb didn‚Äôt worked but Alexa rocked."
556,The main disadvantage is it's not portable and requires continous power supply and it's not mentioned in product description. Sound quality is very poor. No bass. It's just like playing songs in your mobile.
557,"Good for light speaker use, don't expect a boom out of it. And yes, Alexa is awesome, but buy if you have use, don't just go with the trend."
558,I like this because whatever I tell to Alexa it listen. When you have to listen joke tell Alexa open hindi joke. When you have to listen song tell Alexa open best Bollywood/Hollywood song and it will open automatically. But when you purchase this product . At first you have to go in playstore and download Alexa app and other thing you have to do and it is necessary also. I thanks Amazon for making this type of product.  Thanks  From  üáÆüá≥
559,¬†Really this product was amazing my experience very well with the my routine work Alexa remember me Alexa set the alarm in many more works play the songs in enjoy with us
560,"Image just for referenceAlexa is best in voice recognition and it says some times, sorry mujhe nehi patha which irritates me, the answers were simpleAlexa needs more improvements in hindi language and expecting it to be launched in regional languages too,Extreme happy is that I bgot it for just 1314 rupees onlyI know many of you will not believe üòÇ"
561,"1. Voice recognition is poor esp with accompanying Wipro smart bulb.2. It frequently says that ""it is not able to connect to internet"" however it works fine after it is RESET. So the problem is not internet."
562,"It doesn't have option to add major Indian music apps like Gaana, Jio Saavan and Wynk music apps. You can only link Amazon music, Apple Music and Spotify, so it's very difficult if you already subscribed in these app. This is the major issue otherwise everything is too good"
563,"Won't connect to the other devices, doesn't link to my Amazon music just knows hungama music maybe due to tie up but didn't think I would be using it for music purposes only as it's useless in every other sense.. It's better to have a speaker than an Alexa."
564,I bought in Echo dot in sale its working for just one month after till this time its not yet connect with my wifi also its not user friendly. Feels like they rid of money its totally waste
565,Wow
566,"Bought for my family entertainment, purpose solved, enjoying with the product, sound quality satisfied, worth to buy"
567,"Voice recognition is very good . Alexa integration requires future upgrades in its AI capabilities. Since, only specific phrases , that to in particular order would activate proper correct response. Sound quality is fairly good for such a small device."
568,"Who love technology this product is good for them & im happy with this product but it‚Äôs more interesting when you by other eco devices with it like WiFi switches, WiFi bulbs"
569,Been using this for last 5 days.Setup was a breeze. Establishing connections was pretty simple...with minimal effort  connected to my Bose Mini II. Build quality is very basic... certainly has room for lots of improvement on that front.Bass levels are inadequate and hence the need for connecting to slightly  better speaker Bose.However my need was to get onto the Alexa Ecosystem ... so very basic speaker is something i could live with.
570,"this product is great, sure there are sometimes she cant answer but most of the times she can,she can play music, answer alot of questions and if you have smart devices like fire tv then alexa can on them by command.thats why i recommend you to buy it."
571,"Ans for a fixed question only,unable to give ans for all question,I ask where is chittorgarh fort, the ans is i don't know.its not self learning ai"
572,Product done very well for up to on month. But when I deregistered for some problemAfter that it is not connecting to jio fi network.please help me
573,"It doesn't recognise the voice everytime and it makes me repeat multiple times before I get what I asked for. Overall sound is nice but sometimes it gets low automatically. And for most of the things it has only one answer which is "" I don't know"". I expected much more from it. Google works more precise than Alexa."
574,This product is high quality material and high technology. Very easy setup for smart home and fire TV stick.
575,"Poor collection of songs.Poorly bifurcates songs as per year, playback singer"
576,we had received one earlier and now bought the second one. the sound is very good and alexa also responds well. one can good net connectivity else it may not work.
577,¬†I love this product because of nice voice recognition. And i buy this product because of first i want to listen audio songs or stories second main important for my kid whom i want to learn stories and poems thorough this device. So amazing..
578,We feel like we have one more family member at home.Alexa is very friendly. She is funny sometimes. We enjoy with her. She is good assistant. She knows everything. A caretaker to grandparents. A friend to youngsters. She knows almost everything. I cant describe in words.A must buy for every home.Buy immediately
579,¬†What the hell is going onSelling duplicate productNow also Amazon is trying this cheap taticsWasted my time
580,Most worst product ever purchased on Amazon. Don't expect such a useless product on Amazon and by Amazon.
581,It's good but device should have something like phones if it's been stolen we should get to know in which location the device is and who is using... Add this facility.
582,"Best buy u should try it, it is big in size . It is good And it has good voice recognization. It has best sound quality. It has special features.It Is very smart.............And I wanted it  from long time and next i will buy the echo dot 4th generation"
583,"Don't believe the cashback announce by amazon will provide the same.  In my case, cash back not received 5% as stated in september, 2019 (even collect the coupon).  Now, they are asking to provide the screen shot for the same.  Now, they have removed the link.  Same offer announced in october, 2019."
584,"The sound quality is too good, after listening to it i am planning to change my home theatre.  It understands words spoken by my lil daughter that good. I am so happy now time will tell about durability."
585,"¬†I liked this inbuilt 15 watts 360 speaker, good bass, mid and treble quality... Alexa voice recognition and clouds of features are amazing"
586,It does not respond to us when the volume is above 5... It doesn't have hell lot of info with her.... Have to make her understand again n again about what we want her to play for us .. still this can be improved in many ways... It's not advanced..
587,Ai should be improve .It should do things like Google assistance like easy. In few things Google assistance nailed .But for shopping and interlinking with Amazon account is useful
588,"¬†This is my second one...the earlier one was having a louder sound.,this one is taking instruction after repeating again and again...this seems to be refurbished."
589,"The Product was very difficult to set up, the interface is very bad it is not lucid. The AI isn't that great. The operation & function of the echo dot is very limited. The Echo Dot software has lots of glitches and it isn't docile.This product is not worth the money you pay."
590,"What a Terrific Purchase specially for my Daughter, I feel Alexa is my second daughter because my 3 year daughter control it. Bit slow after the updateNobody can't beat Alexa"
591,AI needs improvement ...Doent use google for searches... doent recognises commands quiet often... animal sounds need improvisation (kids skills overall needs updation)Voice recognition n audio quality is awesome ...Pls update software ...
592,"Excellent product.. Only drawback of this product is when it is connected to my Sony soundbar via bluetooth Alexa voice recognition won't work while paying music. However when music is played without connecting to bluetooth Soundbar, it works great without any issues.. Hoping for the update to fix this problem.."
593,¬†the speaker is of very good quality and having decent sound output.
594,Over all good product.. but if amazon allow alexa to search with google also .. the search could be much better
595,"Easily reconogies everyone's voice even of 3yrs old kid. Sound quality is really good,  worth buying."
596,Absolute very smart device by amazon. I have connected this to an external sub woofer and it sounds amazing. It recons my voice from even a closed room. It has like almost all collection of songs be it english or hindi. A must by and quite a money's worth.
597,Build quality and design is good.But Google services like YouTube cannot be linked.This is the major drawback.But AI programming for alexa is highly genius.
598,Totally waste of money product as I received... Alexa not recognised my voice properly. Always need a wifi connection with excellent network to work Alexa. üëéüèª Not recommend to buy this. You can go with Google assistant speaker instead of this.
599,Using from almost a year now . Perfectly fine in sound quality and voice recognition. I recommend this if you love listening music  and to operate smart devices. But sadly it doesn't give proper answer if you ask general knowledge.
600,Set it up and started to command Alexa to do my bidding. Son and missus also love it. The sound quality surprised me coming from a small speaker. Tried to connect with a bluetooth speaker but not successful. There is a learning curve that must be tackled though.  The test drive will go on for some more time. But so far so good.
601,I bought this for my small home and it is working very effectively. Only thing is that I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to connect my Samsung tv with Alexa. The sound quality and voice recognition is very good
602,This is the third Alexa I have.  It‚Äôs Mike is very good and the speaker quality is also awesome. Definitely worth every rupee. Go for it.
603,"One of the best gadgets which you should keep at home.Amazin quality and sound performance. Easily integration and thanks for a lot of features you can use. Good Work Amazon, Nice Product, I would recommend for this device so you can see how Machine Learning will change our future and this is what we will see in next 5 years every year."
604,Initially difficult to connect it later I ve seen the video from you tube... After connection it works good.. Nice product.. Don't know about the long-term use
605,"It's good product as per the expectation if you are new for this kinda thing, but need to improvise on the voice recognition part , It's a catch if you are not good at acsent of the linguistic language hoping to speak."
606,At beginning it was amazing. Later I'm just using it for music and news nothing else.Its quite handy if you want to know something quickly.
607,"The product is very good...... But there is not much u can do with it right now..... Just some news, music n light operations tats allSmart homes are a long way to come by."
608,Some times need to call the name Alex multiple times as she would not respond. Other than that it's fine.
609,‚ÄúFirst impression is last impression‚Äù really echo is a best companion of all time...  sound really good rich bass treble everything what you need to rock the floor....Really appreciate you people work behind of this project..Really amazon cheers
610,Good product... bought it during EOSS for around 1999/- make sure you buy whenever the product is cheaper than the regular price... wait for amazon big sale period...
611,Good one. Go for it.
612,Sound quality is excellent but without internet  it is usless. Its not even wireless or battery operated that is one of its main cons....Its not worth buying.....
613,the device was ok for 1 year. then one random day it failed to connect to wifi/bluetooth. talked to customer care they declared it defective. warranty expired.
614,Alexa is dumb when compared to Google Home. I think I made a mistake by buying this. Instead should have gone for other AI assistant available in the market.
615,¬†Superb..
616,"When the music is playing on the Echo dot, it doesn't always pick up the call word. You'll have to be either close to it or speak loudly. Other than that the product is really good. Sound quality is also pretty good. Will update this after a month of use."
617,How to detect charging is on or off..it is not showing any light while plugin... It show only for few seconds then disappears.
618,Ain't very responsive to the voice commands and the quality of sound reproduction and accoustics is sub-par to say the least.
619,"When i purcahsed Redmi TV, i was told that it get connected to Redmi TV, but i was unable to connect it, when contacted the amazom customer care on how to set this up with, they were unable to help me, morever they promised a call back which never happened"
620,The best product. Many times I thought that blessed that amazon giving service in our time
621,amazon Echo Dot (3rd) gen is working as expected to the extent now I am thinking why did not I buy the next gen with video
622,The sound quality is good however I found 2 cons in this.1. You always need to connect speaker with plug else it wont work. There is no battery back up2. Alexa would not get everything you say most of the time so you end up choosing to select your song sometime manually rather than giving command to alexa.
623,The new 3rd Generation echo dot is not as good as Amazon claims...I think 2nd generation is better than 3rd generation in almost all aspects mic being the top most... You can't use it more than 10 feets away but 2nd generation I am using that 20 feets or more.
624,"I need to call alexa atleast 4 times, then it will response once"
625,Echo Dot is the best home personal assistant at this price range. Alexa listens to whatever you ask her to do and does the task excellently. I am highly impressed by this device.
626,1) There was an ongoing issue happening with the Wipro smart light not getting paired with the echo device.‚ÄãHere is the case ID: 03036247912) voice Search accuracy is not good.
627,Nice product I loved it very much it has made my life happier by listening to various songs and music
628,"Echo Dot recognise your voice well , good at playing music , alarm and reminding important thing to you . There's a little problem It always in search of songs as i asked For a GK question . Is you are a student and want help in study its not for you then !"
629,Excellent sound quality..l am enjoying. Coudnt expect such wonderful sound from a small device like echo dot 3rd gen. I got it in a bundle offer with syska smart bulb. That too has delighted me.
630,Amazing product.Pros:Amazing voice recognitionGood sound qualityEasy to installCons:Amazon needs to improve on Alexa skills.Need more Alexa skills.Connecting to non amazon products is bit tricky.Overall a worthy product.
631,"Totally unnecessary in life! But once you have it, it becomes kinda difficult to live without it üòÄüòÄ"
632,"Alexa mostly understands everything, but still there are some simple things that she wasn't able to search and get results. Like i asked who is General M M Narvane. But she wasn't able to tell anything. Not even she told anything about current Navy Chief. These are some loopholes. But other than that i have found her amazing overall on every aspect."
633,It required lots of improvement. Like it is not that much features like Google Assistant has. Voice recognition issue. But not very bad. It has lots of good things also like we can use as bluetooth speaker and sound quality.
634,Worst smart speakers in the market ... after a few weeks its sound became noisey and distorted .. unbearable. And they will not even replace it . Please avoid if possible
635,¬†The echo dot i recieved doesn't deserve a single star. I am trying to turn on but it's not working. Wosrt experience and destroyed the expectations.Please Always test the product at lab or somewhere before making deal with customer.
636,"I would not recommend it. Ordered it and it's been almost 1 month now. It doesn't detect even if you call it multiple times. Doesn't understand basic commands like pause, stop. Doesn't respond.Very disappointed, hope had ordered Google Mini instead"
637,"Good productI don't think it takes music and other stuff from google or youtubeMost of the music is from hungama music or jio savanVoice recognition is averageAlso tells us the weather,temperature,air quality and also sets alarms and stuffWe can play a bunch of games tooI like it as my first smart speaker"
638,Amazing echo dot. However the size is not as expected to be as in pictures. Its pretty small as compared what we see on the site. Its quite small.. optical illusion i guess..hehe.... having said that i am still satisfied with it !!
639,"Alexa echo is value for money, my lo (3.6yrs) can use it too, he asks to sing out nursery rhymes and stories, and its a hit 99%."
640,Product is Good but no bettery and no internet then dummy.ALEXA INPUT IS BETTER THEN THIS ONE
641,We have setup multiple echo devices and speaker. 3rd Gen is little bit let in terms of recognising your voice from a distance. Overall good.
642,Voice recognition was too bad. Totally disappointed with the product voice recognition. Definitely Amazon should improve their voice recognition software.
643,Loving it üòç but a disadvantage is that it does not play songs from youtube must add on this feature nd i wanted to but alexa with built in battery but unfortunately when i made plan to buy eco dot amazon havent launched in built battery version must  go for tht guys
644,"Got Alexa 3rd gen free with purchase of OnePlus 50inch tv last week, it is simply awesome my 4 yrs old kid loves n commands Alexa to play songs and it recognises his words"
645,"To my surprise - the sound is actually great. Alexa recognizes my voice from afar and syncs information correctly. Overall, great experience."
646,Really worth buying Alexa for smart clearly understands everything what you need and sound quality is superb
647,"Blue tooth connectivity is of poor quality and the volume is bad. wanted to return it, but missed the window for return by 2 days."
648,Voice is very clear üòÉBut if it's without plug work it is more demanding echodit 3rd generation
649,Good and loud soundRecognition is faster than Google home this is  more loud than Google homethis is worth of money
650,Got it for a steal price. Sound better than I expected and it recognizes the voice commands so well!Definitely buying another even if I have to pay double of price I paid for this.
651,"¬†Alexa is not working and responding to my commands, while the internet connection is good and stable this suddenly happened after some days of usage don't know what to do please somebody help"
652,"There is no Bluetooth connectivity from any phone that's why i give 1 star . This is useless who play songs from smartphone to this device . No battery in it we spend 3500.00 for this but there are no battery , no Bluetooth . I return this ."
653,"Try to get more like youtube and sometime phone integration is headache, rest sound and voice is all excellent. A good competition to google"
654,"1. Value for money,2. Nice Sound no need of external speakers,3. Talks nice hindi too,4. Small so no need of extra space.Suggestion: if Amazon can provide integration with other music app like wynk, ganna etc."
655,¬†Very good but can be improved.
656,"Listening instrumental music and devotional songs and YouTube audios of Tamil puranas and Idhikasams like thirumanthiram, best internet companion for retired people."
657,It is good but needs apps for every thing like media movies or needs external cable works with wifi .It's AI still has to be developed in the way it should get adjusted according to the user..At first the product was little disappointed but now it is okay still some features has to be developed for ease in usage like commands working in a long distance with Bluetooth products
658,Every thing is fine i can connect it with my Android's wifiYou don't need hotspot if ur mobile has wifi you can easily use thisI listen most of the songs on this but some songs are not available on thisBut that is really small number of songs if you want to buy prime member ship you will get all the songs.one thing disappointed me that when i connect my Bluetooth it soung like normal cheap speaker i don't know why.
659,Its good i speak to alexa from the other room with volume 10 and it still recognise my voice its so cool.You need to buy one more device if you want to make it smart like ex for making fan and lights on it cannot do it on its own it needs one more device only tht one problem and the best part us tht product cost over 1k
660,"""i,m having difficult y try after some time""These are the words Alexa says"
661,This is very very very bad product at first it was working fine but after a few days it started lagging. I searched for a song it played but at the middle of the song it stopped working. Very very Very very disappointing product don't buy this product it is utterly waste of money
662,Alexa is not responding properly most of the time.  Not catching the command. Smart Switch is OK
663,Thanks to Amazon for this amazing product and I loved itmoreover my nephew and my neice liked it so much and spending more time with itsounds great and faced no issued with connectivity too
664,"The mic work great, but the audio output lacks both the feel and the punch."
665,Bought it 2 weeks back - good timepass .gives good information too .Hindi language is also fun.1 star less as it doesnt pair with LG smart Ai TV - which is very surprising and annoying
666,Not suggested. Stoped working after 4 month after purchase. It will stuck between commands.and not able to pair even after reset.. it shows lag too.
667,There are some issues with the voice command as we have to give commmand twice and after that it works but it should act after one command which is not at all good. Amazon should solve this issue as soon as possible.
668,voice recognition sound quality both are good i purchase this lighting deal with wipro bulb just 2299 but bulb comes  used one not new.
669,Amazon alexa echo dot works fine and it hears me when I speak effortlessly and responds. Honestly I don't know what to do with alexa just I purchased out of excitement and to experience it.
670,After using for few days I am totally impressed.Easy to set up.I am using Alexa for the first time and it is very interesting to learn how Alexa works.
671,Setup process is very complicated and it's not getting completed ..  nor playing anything in speakers.. only amzone Alexa app is working.. network disconnecting by its own. Very disappointed .. m gonna return this very soon.
672,"Use less product ,instead buy Bluetooth speakers."
673,Difficult to connect if you don't have proper 50+ mbps wifi broadband. Also it fails to recognize voice while the network flips. Moreover the product is average but needs a lot of improvement.
674,"I liked the product....it's great...nd sound quality is quite good.The only fault I discovered is the recognition of voice... actually Alexa is unable to recognise voice fast...either it takes a lot of tym or sometimes it just don't even play the required stuff...nd i thnk the system is quite complexüòÖbt then it's in my case...the manual will help u quite.well, beginner will find it difficult to operate at first bt then u will get used to..."
675,What a solid piece of plastic. Good sounding speaker with a color bulb under 2000 was such a good deal.Sound quality is quite good. Can rock a room single handedly. Voice recognition somewhat okeish. Alexa works like a charm though
676,"Set up was easyInbuilt speaker is excellent, sound quality is very niceBluetooth connectivity is also excellentVoice recognition and understanding is really goodOverall Amazon Alexa is excellent."
677,¬†Product is awesome but it should have also supported youtube
678,"Alexa user interface is nice we get most of the information with one voice command.. Music options are very less they should have interface with youtube songs, Ganna app etc"
679,Expected more than just on/off this and that .. Can't even turn a light on at a specific time by voice command while phone's built in google assistant can do that!!
680,"Best experience with alexaAwesome sounds qualityBest integrationButNo battery storage facilitiesWhen i off Internet, this thing not integrate anything ( like time, bluetooth connection,Alarm. If It may possible , we can get better experience)But the working is goodBuild qulity is awesomeCommanding goodTotaly good experience"
681,Great product all function work fine easy installation and sound quality and Amazon delivery and support too good
682,I'd not choose this item bcoz it lacks basic things nor does it assist u as desiered
683,A nice product especially when you get it for the deal i got. I bought it for just 2299 with smart bulb. So overall satisfied worth what i got.
684,"I overall liked the product, it was exactly as i was hoping for and the might facinates so much and make it different from others, its worth the price. The sound is very clear and soothing and alexa is good in answering just not do voice recognition for one person so it will listen to everyone and its connectivity is good too, if you see a yellow light blinking then that is a notification light you can turn it off through your device."
685,It's like a person in our house....iam happy that I got Alexa...tq Amazon for the offers and suggestions....
686,"¬†Bought for my kido , he loved it best thing for gifting thanku Amazon"
687,Good sound quality. i have Google Nest hub also Alexa not more than smart than Google
688,Amzon gave combo offer for echo dot and smart bulb..for 1999..but Amazon cancelled the echo and..thet only  send the wipro smart bulb..for 900..rs..balance 1073 rs will credited with 3 working days ..i dont know ..worst selling concept to sell the product..
689,"The product looks sturdy, but it irretates when it can't understand your commands. Especially it does not fulfill the requirements to listen old music.Sound Quality is good.Struggling how to connect with Bluetooth but yet not successful. This means the integration is quite difficult results in no connectivity with Bluetooth."
690,This product is somewhat good also bad also because you have to communicate with Alexa by connecting it with plug all time.Another bad fact is that it uses wifi to work.But it has a clearer and better sound.You can not ask Alexa about your studies as it replies in high standard manner.But it's overall a helping character for me
691,It doesn't understand what i asked it to do& If you give it multiple tasksIt will saySorry i couldn't understand that
692,"Alexa is a growing child, and I would like to hold her hand because it is too cute.Q. What I like most about Alexa?Ans. Its sound quality and the the glowing light.Bonus tip- buy it on offers, it will be more beneficial for you."
693,Gifted it to my mother for her birthday this year. She‚Äôs having a lot of fun discovering so many new features. A great way to ease your parents into IoT :)
694,Pretty good speaker with some smart features... I bought this just to connect to my big speaker via Bluetooth and listen to my favourite songs without using my mobile... But the sound quality is sop awesome I use it by default by not connecting my big Bluetooth speaker... As echo dot has great bass and volume...
695,"It was bought to solve the purpose. Purpose solved. Was contemplating which version to buy. This version is absolutely perfect. I have a fire stick, and you can easily control the fire stick from the Alexa device."
696,"The product is good but the biggest disadvantage is that its not a bluetooth speaker. Also you cannot control it from mobile. You have to think every time give command every time for the song. You cannot play any playlist. Alexa doesn‚Äôt understand every command. The sound is good. If looking for a speaker, this is one of the worst options."
697,"As a long-time me  having owned several Amazon Echos, I can tell you that Alexa is certainly worth it. ... In years past, purchasing an Amazon Echo Is Passion.Just Go For ItIt's Design is also very Unique"
698,Better wake up than siri or Google assistant...Much faster nd accurate than otherLoved itSound quality is beyond imagination.If having no budget issue than go for 4th generation otherwise 3rd generation is also good one.
699,"Excellent ..She has become my family member now ..She reminds me ,she wake me up,she sings for me .. Specially relaxing rain and thunder sound while sleeping ...Amazing purchase ..Very much happy"
700,Alexa integration is still a pain. Sometimes doesn't hear us speak. Need to talk loud. Phone integration is still very bad. Took me each time 30 mins.
701,Calling Alexa in the early morning instead of calling my wife or my kid is very difficulty. There should be an edit option regarding the name of 'Alexa'
702,Not too much compatible and recognised the voice is little complicated
703,"I purchased product in Aug 2020 and in  less than 5 months, it is not working. Request to replace the product or return money as the product is under one year Warranty. Thanks"
704,They change power socket do its now only a home product..previous version can be use in car also.Amazon should integrate sim 4g/5g module in alexa them only it will perfect product of automation...
705,Didn't understand my voice properly. Voice recognition service must be upgrade. Didn't understand proper hindi. Sound Quality average.
706,"This idiot Box needs internet connectivity and power supply all the time. For Alarms why the hell does it need internet connectivity, otherwise it doesn't beep. Rest all things are fine."
707,Overall it's a good product. The only issue I found is that you need to speak loud especially when it's playing songs. The more the sound of echo dot the more loudly you need to speak.
708,Everything is ok of echo dot but withot plugin u cant use it..many of things it says i dont know..such as bhajan and stories of krishna and bed time stories for kids..
709,Such a cool invention..... even kids can also operate it as per their choices.Very Happy with the Alexa
710,I returned it worst product ever seen ..no sound doesn't understand most of the songs useless plss don't ever buy this ....don't get into the greed of grapping the Maha Sale discount
711,Very durable device. We love the sound quality even aftet eight months of purchase. Great built quality. The Alexa software on android is bit slow.
712,Some time alexa do not respond to command just light glow and go turn off some time it take too much time to interact with devices like plips bulb Or sunoff switch
713,Very useful product smart home. Voice recognition was awesome. I never had to wake up for or lights on and off and also for AC temperature. I just said Alexa set the temperature of AC
714,"Tried a lot to connect wifi, but couldn't. Buy the product which is having with internal battery. We can power the device only with the cable provided with the device."
715,"It required to connect with wi fi once you disconnect , I'm using mobile WiFi , it is very difficult to connect with the echo dot again and again. I think it needs WiFi available all the time and that too not to be disconnected.It is not user friendly.I want to refund it kindly advice how can I do that??"
716,"Easy access of Song is good but voice recognition and sound quality is not good,it requires improvement. It is not able to play all the song wish."
717,Sound better and  gets louder than the home mini !. Fekte sturdy in the hand and the mic response is just awesome!But not the smartest speaker  ai still requires improvement
718,"We need to literally shout to get its attention when a songs is playing and we need to change it. Also the software experience is a bit creepy. Overall you could get a good package but the voice recognition needs to be improved, it's poor than other smart speaker of the segemnt in the market!!!!!"
719,"Eco dot has stooped working after 3 months of usage. At times when we play songs , it stops for few minutes and then again it starts itself. Amazon team, please rectify this on priority."
720,"It's a good product.. But most of the times it says "" sorry I didn't get that "" it's very annoying..."
721,Good low cost Alexa device. The sound quality is average. Voice recognition is good.
722,Frnd this is made in china.
723,Good Product and easy to install. Got in the offer. Voice recognition is excellent. Even Alexa catch my 3.5 year old son's voice for few rhymes.Thanks Amazon
724,This device is good but after 10 days of purchase it is taking me into troubleWhen i say alexa to play a particular song then it says me to cannot play it on tune in what is meaning of that and can someone please help me in that ?
725,"Built quality is good, sound is also awesome. Only drawback for me is Audible integration. Also I'm hoping availability of Spotify as a music service provider."
726,Very good product.its voice recognition is very good only you have to nearby the device.sound quality is very good. Wifi connectivity is also good. The device is bigger than it appears in the website. The adopter quality is very better. It searches songs very faster than google search. It‚Äôs worth to buy.
727,Alexa voice recognition is pretty good and well integrated with other devices. Sound quality is also good and easy to use
728,It Was Arrived With A Bundle Of Wipro Smart 9W bulb that doesn't connect and voice recognition is worse ...as it claims it can hear it from another room...it's just a myth .... It even doesn't hear about 4 m away .... although Alexa only plays music from Amazon prime music... Unless specified by Spotify or apple music
729,"Good interactive device, quality speaker and very easy to connect with other wi fi device. Especially kids will love Alexa."
730,A great smart speakerVoice recognition is goodNot internet is wasteGood for smart home and timepassBut buy it in sale only
731,I bought this For Rs1075 in great Indian Festival.  Useful for people who hear lot of music and podcasts. Having smart device with alexa Integrated is very useful even though i have only smart bulbüòë
732,¬†Good product.. essy to control any device by anywhere.And good sound quality.
733,"The best sound and voice recognition. Ease to place items in cart, play songs, bedtime stories, rhymes and many more. All in one device. Great deals during sale. No issues so far"
734,"1999, it was a steal...simply irresistible. Would like better integration with bulb...sometime takes time to reconnect after being swtiched on...."
735,"Sound quality - 5 starsAlexa integration - 5 starsSetup - 5 stars.In short, no second thought required if you are thinking to purchase smart speakers. Echo dot does it all"
736,Not as expected
737,Alex get hanged everytime. She dont understand the command.Is there no warranty period.if the product is faulty Amazon can't take responsibilityI want replacement imm
738,"Everything is good except that power plug n power adapter.. we can't connect it to power bank or in car... That's why it's useless product , I m thinking to return it? Atleast Amazon has to provide some sort of connector so that we can use USB input to power plug.... That's the only reason why I m giving 1 star for the product..."
739,Enough sound for big hall room..Easily integratable with smart devices .AI for voice learning is too good.One dislike doesn't awnser all questions.
740,"It's a nice product.Sound quality is good, easy to operate. Design is good.Cons:- there is no battery options. We can not take this outside without plugin power supply."
741,"Alexa purchased on 20-22 oct 2020 , now today it is not connecting and not working within one year, hope it will get replaced by amazon."
742,"After one use, the echo dot is not getting connected to my phone. The orange light lights up for mere 3 seconds. The problem is persisting since 2 months. Please help if there is any way."
743,Bad it's didn't ply odia all lovable song we want so don't buy this product. Google home mini smart 2nd generation is good
744,"Sound quality and hardware quality is really good. It is worth the money and using it regularly for reminders, alarms and music. Kid's are also enjoying this device."
745,Non responsive. Plays anything of its own choice.
746,"Customer service is pathetic for Echo device, my device is not working properly & Amazon Customer Service are not helping out for the product, they everytime just give excuse & do not resolve the issue"
747,"Sometimes Alexa hears everything but sometimes Alex doesn't response properly, I have to tell more times"
748,"Doesn't recognise and able to find most of the songs even those are exist in Amazon music, have to repeat voice commands multiple times which irritates me, it's better to have normal spearker and play song manually"
749,Useless product. Not worth for money. It picks song from amazon music but google assistant is much much better than Alexa. Voice recognition is very poor.
750,Ever time it connects with internet.If there is no internet available this is like a waist product inside the room
751,Workes really well with my 30 years old Sony HiFi System. Made my system total wireless. I would have loved it more if there was a battery backup. But thats all right.
752,I found it an amazing product for my use.Alexa helps me in everyday life.
753,I think to use in my office free time. But YouTube was not support and there is no power back up if it Is possible plz change the item to next upgrade with the YouTube support and battry backup
754,"Product is good, but pricing is too varied from 1399 to 3499. Beware on price, try to check price and wait for right time."
755,Voice command not properly wordt..Two or more times voice command give but wrong work..I frastaed with product...Not useful speaker... Update voice command in gujarati and hindi language
756,like everthing from it... the voice.. the commands i gave n it follows
757,Got it For 2200 with wipro Smart led bulb .....one word to say about this is outstanding ..... extraordinary from google mini ...... fantastic ....The only con of this speaker is Low soundOther things Are Mind Blowing...Go for It.
758,Have been using for a monthFacing lot of issuesMic is not sensitive even from few feet away it does not pick voiceAlso when playing aongs on spotify it hets stuck to last played songWe have to reboot it to resume normal functionality
759,That product is so good but I don't love that it has a wire how can I carry that with wire but the simple speker are good we can carry that
760,"No C or D port for power, no Bettery inbuilt, it cant be moved. Not a portable device, what I expected,  I have return for the same reason.  Rest all good. But not recommended."
761,I liked this ..the only prblm was that you have to keep it connected to a power outlet..with such small size ..I found it not worth so instead I exchanged it and bought alexa echo sap which has the power back up of 4 hours
762,"I was expecting more from this, given the price of the product, the quality of sound is average. A bit Disappointed with the product."
763,"If you are playing a song in alexa, and you want to stop music then you have to manually do this , you can‚Äôt interact with it when playing song.Drawback that‚Äôs why i returned it"
764,It's not interesting to my voice in hindi ‡•§ It's set up are very compeleted‡•§ Always it's demand hostpot ‡•§ If u are purchasing this product then u should be keeped two mobile or one router ‡•§then u will be operate‡•§ By the way it's sound quality is best ‡•§ One feedback is it's always depend on power ‡•§ Which one more negative to my point of view
765,We loved it.... especially my sonüëåüëåour first smart speaker
766,"There are hell lot of bugs. Don't know why people are not talking about it. I'm not saying it's a bad product. It's an excellent product. But lot of connectivity issues. Esp if u use blutooth. Sometimes after you connect to bluetooth, it stops listening to your commands altogether. Then you have to reset the whole device. It's a pain."
767,You cannot deny that this product is totally worth the money. I read 100s of reviews before buying this product just to make sure I am not regretting after my purchase.
768,Good Product But sometimes not finding exact on net...
769,Good. Good response. Still learning. Sometimes delay in response.
770,Great product in 2000 rsVoice is awesomeHeavy qualityGood understandingVery user friendly
771,Starting it worked absolutely fine but exactly after warranty its sound breaking very badly. Don't ever buy this product
772,Needs more improvements like sometimes Alexa got hanged and give no response and sometimes response is so late that you can go and come back from toilet. Playlist is large but still not enough.Still overall it's a unique product with good features.But still hoping that one day I'll give 5 star to this product.
773,"the product (echo dot 3rd gen) must be good but I have failed to download the Alexa App on my mobile,I use three moble numbers mentioned below but unfortunately I dont remember which number I used to purchase echo dot:9984082001860460714996518525219793378533kindly help me download the Alexa App on 9984082001/8604607149Dr kiran shanker"
774,Ad ability in India is not working...Let‚Äôs see with 5-G...Company need to work more for that..
775,"Not finding Alexa very much understandable e.g I asked to play song"" Maine dil se kaha"" from movie ROG & sung by KK, it can't. Same happened with song by Yesudas"" Ka karoon sajni"" & ""Main hawa hoon"" by  hussain brothers. Lot  more examples are there.Can anybody help me how to command correctly or Alexa has lot of limitations. In that case a useless product."
776,"First of all a big thanks to Amazon.Alexa is awesome but sometimes it doesn't listen to us, lill annoying.I couldn't find my OnePlus TV in skills and games, lill disappointed.Wish somebody helps with that."
777,While playing music it can't hear voice we have to manually press the button. I feel bad on that. Voice recognition should improve. Sound quality is good.
778,"Waste product, most of the question, not answered by alexa, not user freondly takes lot of time to connect, moreover no customer support after sale. instead of making life simple , customer it has made life terrible."
779,Bluetooth connectivity and Sound clarity (Sound levels demarcation needs alot of improvement)Alexa integration (connectivity / tieup with lot of sources to pick up requests / needs need to improed.
780,Especially as it works in Hindi And have connected to smart devices like Wipro plug etc.The echo dot is a small speaker so quality isn‚Äôt that great but good for 1-2 rooms.
781,They are selling product with defects for less money. Please buy from good seller. I bought this from this seller and the AUX port is not working. Please don't get cheated.
782,I started using Alexa Echo Dot start of Jan'21 and I'm happy with the device. Voice recognition is super and speaker volume as well.Only Cons I feel is trouble in connecting it to laptop in case you need to use it as a speaker by connecting to laptop.
783,"The product is nice... but when ever I ask her something she says ' SORRY I DON'T KNOW', ' SORRY MUCHE YEH NAHI PATA' , my other friends make fun of it and my too, and day Google is better then Alexa...üôÑüôÑ"
784,Alexa integration very weak  n also the sound quality is weak
785,Worst part is half the songs don't play as they are not recognised by Alexa and secondly it doesnt work if you don't connect it to power plug - if you wish to carry it somewhere then it simply wont work if its not connected to power supply
786,"Hi all,Alexa is good product but if they provide battery backup facility and also operate without wifi. It is goodInstead of wifi..if we use mobile network?It is excellent product."
787,"I got it on offer along with a smart light. Both are great, sometimes it takes time to search for songs, but rest all is great. Though It lacks some features like map integration, but i am happy with what it offers. However, if it can have battery backup it will be great."
788,"Loved it.Few tweaks one should apply to get full out of it.Its perfect for home automation and adequate for listening regular light songs and so. But if your sole requirement is music ,that is, if you stressing mainly upon listening music along with home automation, you atleast go with Amazon Echo. You will get better experience."
789,Voice recognition should be improved and not recognized properly.English and Hindi songs are on priority and not in Tamil.Sound quality is good.
790,"I got Alexa a part of the package and was never new this is so good. I would definitely recommend this to others too. The sound quality is amazing on this new echo dot,"
791,Sound quality is so so good..  Working perfectly.. Best product
792,‡Æé‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æü ‡ÆÖ‡Æ≤‡ØÜ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æö‡Ææ ‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Øá‡Æö ‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡Æπ‡Æø‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø ‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æ®‡Øã‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æ™‡ÆÉ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ∏‡Øç
793,I like the way how Alexa understands the things in both hindi/English and perfectly work all cmd.1. access to millions songs2. Control on smart devices
794,Good Product. Overall satisfied and meets expectation. Area of improvement‚ÄîNot able to understand the request at times. Delayed or NoresponseAlso can‚Äôt restrict voice profiles to a limited few. One and all are allowed
795,Why there is no battery backup provision in alexa?.without battery it is just like spot in beautiful moon.
796,It is very boring device and working please don't waste your money and time üò†üò°üò°
797,Nice product.  Good sound quality.  Should help the buyers with detailed connectivity. Tell about how to connect through hotspot.But a great assistant.
798,IT DOESN'T CONNECT WITH SPOTIFY IN INDIA.....AND SAYS THAT SPOTIFY IS NOT AVAILABLE IN INDIA.I BOUGHT IT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF CONNECTING IT WITH SPOTIFY BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.SO HAD TO RETURN IT AND BOUGHT GOOGLE NEST.
799,"After 10 months usage, it's speaker üîä starded sounding like speaking with closed nose. No idea about repair."
800,"I have been using the Echo Dot for over three months and suddenly the Alexa doesn't work without the power cable connected. And since i got 1 year warranty, unable to find a place to return and claim on warranty."
801,Yup prosControls wipro lights amazinglySony braviaCons:Just takes command and waits for a minute for confirmation
802,It's totally waste of money...Voice recognition is very poor if u r playing anything on this device.If u hv too much time to waste then only buy this product. It's not as smooth as shown in Advertisement.
803,I enjoy Alexa Very Much. It has very good combination with Oakter. Purchase Alexa And Oakter and make all your Infrared Remotes Integrated and Alexa Operated.
804,"Speaker could be more clear. Support for more GK questions would be appreciated. Excellent companion for home, highly recommended."
805,Buildup quality is superb.Intelligent device no doubt. It's good for all ages but my preference is for bachelor's or single family.Must buy productAlexa is best thing in my life.
806,Overall product is very good. I tried to use the mic for calling  but it is not possible. Also if you want to search a specific song it is slightly difficult
807,Everyone knows about it just that Indian version has few modifications and settings compared to other Echo dots
808,I use it in my room and it's amazing. Amazon can improve the app experience though
809,To explore n most use u need Amazon prime which is not correct..paid for device bt NT able to use fully due to no prime members .better ho for Google device
810,"¬†Awesome friend and helper, loved it ü§òüòçüòá"
811,I recommend to go for this powerful and smart AI without any hesitant
812,¬†Don't buy Alexa it's ease of money even when I tried to refund they said we are not able to reach customer.... As an independent person they don't let you play regional songs.
813,One of the best purchases in recent times. I had some issues while adding wifi but was finally able to connect.  Very helpful for kids. Got a very good deal during the great Indian festival sale and thanks to GrabOn for the timely alert.
814,"Worst product I received from amazon, it worked well 15 days & stopped working after that, when I requested for return Amazon denied, it seems seller sent me repaired product  Amazon should banned the seller"
815,The Alexa is overall a good smart speaker.But at times it has difficulty in processing the voice commands.sound output is very good.
816,Excellent packing and easy to setup. Item is as described in the product description and works great as expected. Sound quality in 3rd generation really cool. Overall I am happy with this purchase.
817,it was not taking kannada songs recognisation not worthy compare to google assistant ...youtube songsnot taking if we say particular song or song artist but it will not show some one especially kannada ppl dntbuy it
818,Can't work without power...no battery... frequency is not high. U can go for better product in this range that can work without power
819,I usually never review any products but I'm so impressed with echo dot I've been using this for 2 days now and the response is so good I mean I'm stilll learning how to teach more skills n all  but I'm so  statisfyed with echo dot voice recognition is way better then any voice assistant damn you should buy this
820,"It is a good AI speaker,Liked the device very much.Hindi needs improvement in the device.As the device gets older the voice/sound decreases gradually."
821,No need to review this magical device. Just go for it.1. Easy installation2. Fun to use3. Loud speakers4. Easy home automation device
822,I ll order amazon echo dot i m member of amzon prime but my echo its not working proprly. Device is not speak in hindi and not connected proply my phone. Please help me anyone how run echo dot properly. Please
823,Awesome product
824,I purchased this product and with in 3 weeks it stoped working and i got the replacement but the replacement product was not good the sound quality is very bad. They rejected to replace the product. Very bad service and bad quality.
825,Am using 4th generation also. But I like this one.Am not expecting for sounds quality. Bass also good.
826,It is pretty goodAlexa catches your voice very quickly andDelivers the reply very fastlyBut it has a sound range audible in a roomPls amazn my humble request is to add some more languages to enhance the quality of the product it is very meeting to expectationsAnd is totally worth
827,"Recognition isn't upto the mark, the sound quality is not really good as well, and it gets stuck in between while giving commands sometimes and then you need to restart"
828,It‚Äôs not working after 1 month sent complaint but still not received any feedback17- may.. we are still waiting for the call.. I think you should show the courtesy of giving call to a customer29- may ... we have not received any call ..
829,"Dear team, i purchased 3 alexa for my home and after use of 2 months charger of one alexa not working , i checked with another charger and its working so tell me how can i change replace my charger"
830,I purchased Alexa last year but now it's not working since 6 month...highly disappointed üòû sometimes it started working nd suddenly stopped workingüòûwastage of money
831,sound is low.. below expectation.. the voice recognition is also giving problem.. the size is very very small.
832,¬†The product is awesome. I purchased it for listening to music on the go. I really very love the way alexa answers the question. Overall loved it.‚ò∫‚ù§
833,Best prodct ever. It came with an adapter and a light bulb. It can control even my fire tv stick that i had bought a year ago. Not gonna regret buying it as i got it only in ‚Çπ2000
834,"We require wifi compatible devices. I don't have any such devices,  so I have to buy additionally. Otherwise no use for middle class family. Waste of money."
835,Product iz good ...but we can't listen music from utube .....this iz boring yaar
836,"If u have genuine usage and not just gonna want to go for the trend, then only buy it. Sound quality isn't as good as expected. It seemed poorer than a normal speaker. Not that great usage or quality as I have heard it to be."
837,Overall ok. Cannot able to integrate android tv. Expecting tamil skills hope it will be deployed soon. Big drawback is voice recognition when you closer and louder alexa able to recognize you.
838,"Not useful, better to buy a Bluetooth speaker"
839,Very useful Device with home appliance
840,Gifted to my niece . She is fascinated with the product. As Through AI.. it replies to our questions
841,You need to get subscription of all services..  Without that this can't even play a song.  Can't connect or call to your Indian contacts.  Only us numbers are valid for Alexa.
842,"Everything looks amazing except when you try to use Alexa as a bluetooth speaker for your phone and laptop. It really struggles to play sound from mobile and laptops.In short, @Amazon needs to improve the quality of the bluetooth they are using within Echo devices"
843,"It served my purpose, needed bluetooth device and I got voice command based as add on. But still need to improve with voice recognition and desired result"
844,Just buy it. Its worth evwry penny. No ome will be bored again. Very good sound for such a small package.
845,"Works fine, and is good for mid sized rooms. Sound quality could have been improved but the results of voice commands are proper and acccurate."
846,"Alexa is good, listens to my all commands and does things perfectly.. My kids keeps her very busy. I gave only 4 stars and deducted 1 star because for one con which I felt.Atleast they should have given an in build nasty back up which works for atleast 3 hrs. Continuous power supply is needed."
847,"The product being so compact but still sounding soo much good is the best thing in itself.If you are thinking about a speaker with a good sound for a room and you want some smart functionalities with it, go for the Alexa. Its really awesome and do consider buying smart bulb after you purchase Alexa."
848,"Its artificial intelligence is awesome, recognise almost everything in English and Hindi language."
849,Speaker as such excellent. However alexa voice command is useful only when you have those many devices.
850,"It's been few hours though but I am already impressed by the echo dot and the Wipro led both, and the integration between the two is good ...but I am not sure if I can change the color variants of the led through Alexa or not ....rest all is fine for me .....worth for money in the sale"

853,Perfectly working since last 2 months. Very good voice recognition. Speaker quality is good ( better than Gen 4).Should be an option to add battery to it.
854,"Good product but sometimes not listening to our voice when the volume is little high,leading to irritation sometimes :)"

856,This Alexa device speaker is just remarkable  which does All it's function precisely with out an error Voice recognition and sound of this device is fabulous you won't regret buying this alexa device be smart buy smart.
857,Good performance but need more songs.Audio clarity and level is awesome
858,Not able to even power on power off my 65 inch mi tv but could pair with my Sony home theatre and play music
859,Please stop making your customer fool and provide the appropriate details in the detail section with clarification.Not at all happy with your product.
860,"I'm writing this after couple of weeks..Genuinely, I liked the product much.. Compare to other smart speakers, It sounds much humanly..."
861,"Best product i got this year, totally worth it , got it at an amazing price of 1799 during amazon sale. From music to news to controlling your smart home devices it is indeed the best smart speaker out there in the market"
862,Not working this something irritating with Amazon product. For return of the product Amazon put the wrong address and also not resolved my query.
863,¬†Voice recognition is good....
864,after connectivity alexa echo shown 2 nd gen but product box shown 3 rd gen.Not clear the matter about 2nd and 3rd gen.
865,Pair not good nd without plugging not play please refund my amount my amount echo dot pending only 707 payment refund wipro led . Rest payment refund immediately too late
866,"Product not working properly 1st time replacement requested ,replaced one also not working therefore returned not a good experience"
867,¬†It's not working properly check the video and support to resolve
868,Problem in differentiation on Background voice and its own running music sound. It must be update. Has no clear reply on many questions like google home. sound quality is better than google home.
869,"While setting up echo dot - the amzon app in mobile not behaved properly, got hang up - step up is not smooth or not complete - but alexa echo dot is working"
870,Such a worst product .I bought my first Alexa in previous year which is working very fine but this deal offer Alexa doesn't work properly cannot recognise my voice on command is it sellers sell the rejected product ?
871,Item is great. it's easy to use. my kids are enjoying the services of echo dot 3 :). it understands the voice commands without any problem. sound quality is also good.
872,If clock would have displayed it have been a win win situation in eco-dot 3rd generation.
873,"Product is really cool, if you want to start your home automation journey. Sometimes alexa is unable to recognize voice commands, so we need to repeat it couple of times. Most of the alexa integrations or skills doesn't work properly."
874,"Amazing product and works like a charm,  love the experience. If you have kids at home,  it's gonna be a treat to watch them speak to Alexa.Speaker quality is adequate for a std size room and the bass too is effective. A good buy."
875,Want it in marathi language.Why alexa don't understand marathi.Our kid's want to ask questions to alexa in marathi as we belong to maharashtriyan family.
876,Excellent product. Amazing voice recognition and excellent sound quality. Must buy product if you want to minimize workload.
877,Wonderful experience.....very very accurate and so much improvement..... Better than Google I guess
878,"Everything is awsm about this device, if you have the money buy it without a thought. And also loved Amazon's service, I got a problem with the speaker after 6 months but Amazon solved without any issue and within a week, even during the lockdown. Awsm product and awsm service, thanks Amazon."
879,"Dont understand why it should  be plugged in anytime.Given its sleek design one doesnt think that it has to be power plugged all the time.Returning this product,  bad experience."
880,"I was not expecting a huge bundle pack in such a price. In this price I got a top notch speaker and that too smart. Although Alexa won't be answering all your questions, but it's the value for money thing. Voice quality is something you can rely upon it's room filling with amount of base needed."
881,Demo will be helpful for use .
882,"This is awesome or useless that depends on your use...... It has its own pros and cons....Pros like comes with jio saavn, hungama music and gaanaBut its not a multi tasker likeIf you command it to play a song in vol 5It will reply you sorry I don't know or there is no song named ""song's name in vol 5""But I loved itüòç"
883,I got it during the sale on a great price with Wipro bulb. Product undoubtedly is excellent and works like a charm.Calling feature is great and very easy.
884,"Got it for ‚Çπ1375. Great at this price. Sound quality is top notch and bass is also good.Only concern is that to play music we have to be a prime member of amazon or can use iHeartRadio, JioSaavan. But can't sync with other media players.Bluetooth connectivity is also good."
885,The Continuous performance of echo dot completely relying on the internet speed and it's stops in between running.But the Alexa app totally sucks the real experience of using it.
886,"Product we all know, it awesome. Would like to give rating to delivery, I ordered after 7pm and it was at my door step morning 9am, as it was a last minute gift idea, it was bang before time."
887,Quality and value for money . Very nice product.Acts as mini speaker for a room with very very good sound quality . Also extremely useful for smart home . Don't consider this as a main thump speaker.But according to it's size it is a beast with good base
888,Didn‚Äôt work well with Vu tv. Also voice recognition is not as good as google mini. Returned the prodict
889,Tooo much value of money must buy it's price is very less if we difference between shops but it cannot answer in proper hindi but some word understand and response also in hindi
890,"I love this echo dot I love it and there was a funny thing about if you don't know I tell you you say alexa,can you laugh and alexa,mar ja  a funny respond  that I cannot stop my laugh"
891,It has met the expectations...The only was thing i would say it how we handle the cards history on the mobile app. If i want to delete multiple i am unable to do so.
892,¬†Very good
893,This small wonder is an excellent companion to have at home ...only thing that I did not like is that it is much dependent on wifi and for music Amazon has not bundled its Music service with the device.
894,Alexa is just not there in terms of understanding as well as helping out plus integrations wise product is very limited and serve next to no purpose.
895,Packaging was good. Alexa echo dot 3rd generation is absolutely wonderful. Wonderful to talk to. I'm still learning more features of Alexa.  Plays mostly all the songs when asked. But Alexa does not know Hindi Christian songs. A must have for everyone.
896,no work proper..and amzon refund my money but rs 500 less.why?
897,Guys!!If you are thinking what a speaker can do!!!It can tell you jokes .Can Sing.Can play any songs.Can Play Games.Trivia.GK.Fun.News Sports..Ola Uber Zomato Swiggy.U can call and text with only Alexa users Alarms Reminders and Still Counting...All depends on the master
898,"I gifted this product to my father, when I gave him a demo he was fully surprised and loved it. It is very convenient and easy-to-use. Thank you for making such an item."
899,"this item is not working at all in th first day itselfe..it is always showing offline though i have a full speed internet, i want to return this item..i sont eve wat to give one star for this amazoj echo dot"
900,Product is really good and has lot of feautres. But misses few of the additional features of Google. Also lacks in quality of search results.

902,"Product is Excellent,  AI system is great,  ever I tried.  But one more request  to Alexa Team that, kindly work Volume 8 to more,  Alexa face trouble to respond.  OVERALL BEST SE bhi Uppar."
903,Amazing product... Just like a friend in need and knowledgeable too... Perfect sound quality... Takes a bit of time to connect to other smart devices... Owners delight
904,"Voice recognition, alexa integration and portability of the speaker were absolutely fine."
905,Worked Well For 6 monthsnow has become unresponsivetried to contact to get it replacedfacing problems there tooamozon team plz help

907,"Voice recognition is not up to the mark, while playing a song it would not respond to our voice have to Click on action button to set normal again. Would be great if this is resolved in next edition."
908,"Wow. What a product. I got in mind that Alexa is almost same as, in olden days, at rich families you saw servants who are always ready in position to execute your orders."
909,"¬†This is cute little speaker. Sound quality is also fine.,but a little low if you love loud music.I personally like it's sound quality. Sad part is it's not Wireless. Otherwise it's all good!"
910,"All good but sometimes difficult to identify the content, i love the sound but good if it could have portable battery."
911,"I am unable to setup alexa app in my mobile ,always find error to no network connection ,please help me"
912,¬†Sound quality is good but mobile wifi not working and not good connectivity
913,"It dies not even play the recognised songs, which played few days back.. And keep on saying not understand. How could the song which played earlier.. She didn't recognised which even mentioned in hungam"

915,Superb Product. Very helpful for all - especially for children. I just love it. Thank you amazon for creating a revolution.
916,"Very nice product, already had Echo now got this dot to gift.. beautiful product"
917,"The product is good no doubt.But However Amazon confused me with pics were there is clock , but unfortunately that is a whole different product."
918,"Doesn't give you national newa, or local news. Not update. Older version."
919,¬†Good to pass some time. Kids enjoy talking to Alexa. Easy to get lot of information
920,"Initially I was bit apprehensive. I bought this as demanded by my princess. The only thing that matters is , she liked it.I have also started using it bit though not much."
921,"Very nice ,voice recognition is also good and sound quality is best üëåüëåüëå"
922,My 5 year child giving instruction in hindi and his fumbling language even Alexa is recognising requirement with his voice and responding with actually result.
923,Not worth for money. Google assistance is work better than this.  Don‚Äôt buy Alexa . Voice recognition is very poor.
924,The sound is not very clear.
925,¬†Alexa echo dot 3rd generationVoice recognition amazing
926,This is a very good gadget to have. It gives a loud audio output and recognises the voice very well. The responses are also very nicely configured. I am able to use it in English and Hindi languages very comfortably.
927,Its loud but have no bass and doesnt work wireless
928,¬†Go for it... No complaints
929,"This is my 2and purchase, the one bought in sale doesnt recognize voice, doesnt play  most of the times its yellow popup.  Dont go for ones in sale  they send defective product's"
930,Thanks Amazon care for understanding the genuine issue in the first device! Return was smooth and fast! The new Alexa Echo is working as per my requirements and expectations! Keep up the great work!
931,"I am just using it for couple of days.This ""Alexa integration"" is a wonderful thing beyond my expectations.i have not tried with Bluetooth connectivity but getting good results with wi fi connection.i think it will be a necessary item for everyone.i am very satisfied with this.very attractive also."
932,"Its the best portable and small device I have ever seen. It plays music .it will answer your questions listen jokes from it ,and the best part is it can also speak hindi .must buy alexa"
933,Alexa not search my favourite songs she doesn't understand what I said I have to tell full song name and singer names like Alexa play kuch tum kaho from ganaa savnn Amazon prime music etc very bad experience üôÑ
934,So nice speaker. I used this speaker everyday. The new alexa skill is so cool. Black colour of alexa is look decent. I'll strongly recommend go for it.
935,It's a very good product. Delivers what it is intended for.
936,just excellent a must need for everyone
937,Amazing product to have if your budget is under 3k.I got this product and syska smart bulb for 2600rs from amazon sale.A lot has been provided at this price point which is amazing.One plus point is you can use it as a normal speaker as well.Wonderful product.
938,Nice product must purchase for a smart home.
939,When i trying to connect my Bluetooth to eco dot then its showing 'an app is needed to use this device.'  Pls fix my problem
940,"I have two echo dots. this one doesn't even wake up when i call it. only after successive tries it wakes up. In-fact before this wakes up, my echo dot downstairs wakes up. so disappointed."
941,Alexa can still grow and become better and understanding could get better. And if Alexa can't understand what device you are talking about it would be better if it stops saying did you mean TV..
942,Alexa is good value for money and fun to use. When using in India make sure u select English India as language so that it can relate to our conversations and media content
943,Many times I have to try to install in my phone but not connected I don't know why this happened please help me otherwise I will return this item..
944,The claims of the advt about the product is baseless. I cannot add the device to Android phone despite repeated attempts for two days. It is a useless product and a pure waste of money
945,Alexq 3rd gen smart speaker is good.There is a slight delay in recognizing voice..otherwise its a good product... Thank you amazon.hoped that will be fixed in the future update.
946,The voice recognition is so poor most of the times and it's not even listening and playing irrelevant songs rather than the asked one...and every time the sound goes low ...What the f is this ??
947,Not complete music play and needs to tell the song and singer to select one song.. very less information.. can work only what available on wiki and amazon music.. kids rhymes are also limited
948,I am happy with the product. If you have amazon subscription and a stable wifi then it is recommended to choose this product . I liked this. It doesn't have battery/backup. It requires plugged in all the time.
949,It's  likely good but it has no battery so other than that it's a great experience over alexa
950,Intial 10days the device was alright and working ok whereas from the 11th day it started having problem like it starts making beep noice while the music is playing and i am not able to return the device as they have given 10days time for the return So Amazon help me with this.
951,"Everything is perfect.. I have returned and booked amazon echo input, because amazon echo dot is not portable"
952,"With the price range it's a wonderful productSound quality is greatInbuilt mic is wonderful in quite place but in noisy environments (songs running in echo, it is not able to hear your voice command) its not very responsive. Amazon needs to work on that"
953,Smart speaker with nice voice recognition suitable for indian english with that language setting.Decent sound quality as well
954,Features are very complicated for me. üò¢üò¢ and its very complicated to connect with my tv. And alexa did not listen me. I had return the product in a same day
955,"It‚Äôs ok,but even when u ask the same questions,I feel very Docile,don‚Äôt talk properly due to network problems,Whatever but I Did not make me as happy as the product I had purchased with pleasure."
956,Sometimes alexa doesn't understand what is asked and interpretsaomething else. It doesn't even understand a few Indian names.
957,A value of money product. This is the third one I brought
958,Likes :* Identification of Voice despite of background noise.* Learning platform for Kids / StudentsDislikes :* Can not play Amazon Prime Music; Which is bundled FREE anlong with Echo Dot 3* Suddenly stops responding / Stops Music* Need to implement Indian Accent / Nouns
959,"This is just really good... It feels like talking to a real person with a different voice üòÇ. It took some time to figure out how to connect Alexa to my phone, but eventually everything got intact and everything was just perfect. I love it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
960,Sound quality is good and covers an average house.Sometime Alexa doesn't play the song we want and then doesn't recognise the voice.YouTube search option should also be included.
961,It worth it I got extra 500 rs off as I was having my prime membership and as a speaker it is the best of all
962,Amazon alexa echo dot is best product easy to use. Such a amazing and good sound quality. Light weight handling
963,"All is OK,,but At first it's operating process is so long"
964,"It's a nice product, but there is no power backup. So everytime it neet a plug point while using. It should be improvised with some power pack. Sound I'd good and clarity."
965,Not upto expectation
966,Echo dot build quality and sound quality is very good .It is a very very useful product .And it's vioce recognition work superbly .It's only best option for home automation.
967,Difficult in connectivity. Not so good . Average product
968,Alexa is not recognising my voice and responding instantly when there is a song going on or Alexa is delivering any music or news.Seems there is some problem in this device.
969,Wall hanging facility is not there .
970,Very usefull
971,"Good sound quality, it recognise voice well, but the algorithm which was implemented in the device only in that way we need to ask the questions other waise it will not understand the command(Except that everything is too good)"
972,"Do not buy any alexa enabled device, you cannot setup multiple account unlike google. If your wife or brother use the device then all there request will made via your account. This is very bad."
973,Very good and nice workiing echo dot 3rd generation
974,"Great product!! super quick at taking commands, greatly efficient with other appliances as well, the performance has been the same by far!! what an amazing product offered by Amazon at a super affordable price!!"
975,Voice recognition is not good.. Sound quality is ok.
976,"I m in love with this device. seriously, its too good. million times better than google's home mini sheit."
977,"Add YouTube Music. Hungama music and amazon music don't have all the songs. Specially ""Nunur Bape dome jore"" This Song is not playing by your alexa. Add YouTube music then I will by Once again."
978,This is just amazing if you are looking for something in Budget and that can satisfy the requirements of a speaker along with proper voice integration and recognition go for this blindly.
979,"I got in combo offer 23k mi robot plus 1245 alexa total price  rs 24,245 both are awesome..."
980,"All is good i loved echo devices, but the base is decreased when volume is full please fix it"
981,"Overall product is good but need to improve on software/app integration, sometimes take more time to load alexa app during integration.Also sometimes instruction not followed by alexa and starts song by default."
982,"This is My first, Amazon Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Generation, finally today is received. This smart speaker are amazing and connectivity is good. üôÇ"
983,It got pause and play within every second
984,"What's the use if I have to rely on Google assistant to work with my tv, I have a brand new Sony Bravia 4k tv and this doesn't work with my tv"
985,Tried connected to wipro smart bulb and failed very poor support from amazon.
986,"¬†Don't buy this . Bad service, product is missing when package arrived."
987,5star to this product.  Voice recognition and sound quality is simply great.
988,Good product .. can only play songs available on Anazon music.. not sure if I am missing some thing . Quality is good . Purchase one more for gifting to my elder sis ..
989,"It's good for hindi and English songs, It's recognizing very quickly. But South Indian songs it's not recognizing properly, If u ask any song in telugu or Tamil. It's going to some local hindi songs."
990,Received the product with damaged charger. Seems to be used. Returning the product
991,This is one of my best tech purchases ever. Very useful gadget for handling day to day tasks.
992,I presented this to my nephew. It helps her english language proficiency and also entertain her.
993,Very good quality
994,"Super product,Just go for it,It‚Äôs worth 100%"
995,"Overall it‚Äôs a good quality speaker at the given price. It‚Äôs good for small setup and at average  sound levels , at high volumes it loses the quality a bit . The microphones are average compared to echo plus."
996,It is not having science related or student education quairies information and it is also not giving proper response as i say the name of one song but it listens another and plays another song
997,The alexa is not working properly. Sometimes it does not recognize voice properly. It has a limitation also. It does not connect with any other system by bluetooth or wifi.
998,"Handy voice assistant. Got it in a sale at a reasonable price. Voice quality is good, needs to learn more about Indianised English accent :) ."
999,"Wonderful product at this price.  One can get anything from it like jokes, any song, dictionary metrology report etc"
1000,"Very much satisfied alexa echo dot is awesome, sound quality is very good"
1001,I want only new products but this is like used products....na hi koi packing aur speaker ganda bhi ho rha tha thoda thoda...i don't like this....hang ho rhi hai aapki bheji hui alexa....late response krti hai
1002,"¬†Such A good product of Amazon ever, The sound quality is standard and Advance features of all WiFi Networks or ConnectivityI'm very happy after using Alexa echo dot 3rd generation this is best smart Device...üíØü•∞üòò"
1003,While using echo dot it's always plugged in so it's not useful and while traveling or moving that will not carry because it's required plugged in so it's difficult to carry. Not useful.
1004,Sound quality is not great rest is ok
1005,¬†It is a good product by amazon but there is one thing that takes too much time is to be setup with alexa app
1006,"Good, sound qualitySuggestion, Amazon music does not have good collection and understanding the voice and playing relevant song was 50/50"
1007,"Sound is good but it requires every time pairing up and setting up, that‚Äôs very embarrassing"
1008,For my other room this is perfect! A huge upgrade from the previous generation of the echo dot.
1009,"Some time it's create a problem, when I speak something..... It gives No response and Bluetooth also create problem after 2 hour the sound was gone and I will off and connect it again then voice will come..."
1010,I really liked the concept and the way it works but also if it can operate like bluetooth connected devices like switching on or off would be helpfull.
1011,"Everything  about Alexa is awesome, ease of connection, sound quality, response and home automation is ,"" rapchick"", really helping me to be more organized"
1012,I think Alexa is too smart and the best companion. Only thing I expect more from Amazon or Alexa is to integration with Android TV and applications.
1013,It can only turn off the TV. It can't turn on or contro different functions with TV. I tried each and every possibility but it isn't integrating well with TV.
1014,I like it. Its the best product in this budget. Well. I bought it in the Amazon Great Indian SaleIts a masterpiece.Magnificent and loving Product.Powered by Alexa.Best product.
1015,Loving the sound quality and every feature
1016,"I bought this on prime day offer.  Really it‚Äôs a amazing. They delivered with nice packaging and on time.It‚Äôs has really beautiful sound quality, listening the voice all they way & easy to configure.Worth buying"
1017,Please don‚Äôt waste your money in purchasing this. You need compulsorily have wifi connection. This cannot be connected with Mobile hotspot also not wireless. Better to purchase 500 worth Bluetooth speaker
1018,"Wow it works very nicely,Our family likes it very very very much,Blindly every one can buy,"
1019,Unlike others I use alexa to increase my productivity and manage my schedule. It saves a lot of my time. It recognize my voice very well and has many features which solves a lot of problems. I truly love it.
1020,voice quality could have been better
1021,Good product from Amazon. Worth buy. Need to include Kannada language along with Hindi and English will become much more popular.
1022,¬†It's very nice.it work properly.alexa take comonds properly sound quality is good.value for your money.i suggest every one to buy this.‚ù£Ô∏èüí´üòá
1023,I got it at under 2000 in the Great Indian Festival Sale and I'm just loving it. It is just so much fun and makes my life easier!
1024,Liked the sound quality and connectivity options. But Alexa is less knowledgeable as compared to Google. She doesn't know many things!
1025,"A very gift good for any age, wish Gujarati language option is available. Although combination of English and Hindi is an option, so no issue for non English speakers. Very nice passtime for seniors! Wish Amazon makes it to work while unplugged!"
1026,"It is the most useful item, it handles all my reminders, alarms, shopping lists and even play songs for me as per my likes, found it quite convinient as it makes living simple and organized. Absolutely loved the way Alexa manages it all for me‚ù§Ô∏è"
1027,Seems to be a new member added to our family keeping kids busy. However she hangs up at times failing to resolve the requests which I guess needs some fine tuning
1028,"A nice product from amazon, works fine . Voice recognition is good, still hope it become more powerful . Sound is nice bass is good too."
1029,This device is unable to connect to my Wi-Fi hence it does not work. In the beginning it was working nicely but after nai I wanted to change the Wi-Fi network of this device it start working and it was not able to connect and this sucks!
1030,Yes it is most popular but it doesn't have any use except listening songs cause it doesn't know any more information about most of the things same if you search on google it has every single information
1031,"Alexa speaker is Good But Alexa Android application is not good, Alexa listening skill is also not so accurate"
1032,"The product is really good. Lesser skills on Alexa, should improve on the quality and innovations in the Alexa skills. Sounds awesome and the setup takes a bit more time than expected even with good internet connectivity. And unnecessary notifications and can't handle multiple tasks at once."
1033,Over all performance is vary satisfying. It almost understands every thing I say. It's best for small room.
1034,Its working good but it can't to be used in outside. If u want to use it u will definitely connect to u r connecter and we couldnt connect with u r mobile data. You will connect with wifi only
1035,In the beginning I could not connect my phone to echo dot.. Put my remarks online...received help from the call Centre...I connected echo dot successfully both to Alexa and blue tooth speaker...it is now working fine..
1036,¬†Awesome product.I liked it.Good buy
1037,I believe it's needs to get better on voice recognition and accent of India people .most of them can't say words clearly it's AI can be improved
1038,"command recognition is poor, not able to understand malayalam songs names properly. other wise its good"
1039,All good. But the app hangs on my new one plus 9r which is supposed to be an alexa enabled phone.Which is very annoying!I'll soon switch to Google devices if this isn't rectified!
1040,¬†The design is cool but it don't have that much of beat
1041,Voice recognition is ok because sometime she's not catching even clear words
1042,Good product. Easy to pair with other devices. Sound quality is not so good as expected.
1043,When the product was purchased it played very well.. my child was extremely happy but since 15 days Alexa is playing everything incomplete.. songs get cut in between.. news stops.. don't know what's wrong.  Is it a defective piece so was kept in offer period?? Can we trust in Amazon offers anymore??
1044,"Totally in love with it!! Had a few smart devices to integrate and it works like a charm. . Everything is great. Tho I couldn‚Äôt make it work with a plug. I guess it just needs some refining. But overall, great job Amazon"
1045,Overall great product if you need speaker and as well voice assistant. It all depend upon your need.
1046,"Like the product, but no battery backup available"
1047,Not satisfied with the product. Sense the voice very slow and not user friendly
1048,I really disliked the product. Product was sent defective and they promised for replacement but they denied to exchange. I have wasted my money. I m not to buy anything from this site.
1049,I bought ut from sale and cost me around 1500. Being a user of ECHO 4th generation 4 its clearly lacking. one must go for ECHO 4th Generation.
1050,"Please don't buy , alexa stop working in few months and there is no option for replacement, they are just making us fool"
1051,Delivery of the product was quick and packaging was good. Now I can play all day long with my Alexa
1052,Not as per the expectations. Unable to play youtube musics. Not connected perfectly with fire TV stick.Not happy with the product. Product is completely different if I compare to advertisement of Amazon.
1053,"Price is perhaps the most cru6thing in shopping,I got it for 1700 INRWhich is excellent..."
1054,"Excellent product at the lowest price.Entertaining, Automative, and Funny.Syncs perfectly with Wipro smart light."
1055,Pros: Good sound quality.  Product overall is goodCons: Issue with voice recognition. I have to speak twice or thrice.
1056,"This is trust worthy and beautiful item feel free to buy it, i only buy when i see these kind of reviews so if ur reading this than pls feel free, this is good,"
1057,It doesn't work at all don't buy it
1058,I placed it in hall.. it's very simple to play songs according to your mood just ordering it...
1059,Very very good quality better than google. In it you need internet and prime subscription.
1060,"An excellent product, makes listening to music an effortless exercise. Voice controls makes it all the more convenient"
1061,"voice very gud,alexa recognize everything ,love this product,profit of money"
1062,"Like alexa very much, very easy to configured. Good sound quality, can be audible in whole flat, can hear news anytime now. Kids just love it, anytime they can hear any song, story, rynes etc."
1063,"Sound quality is excellent for this size of speaker, Alexa is working great with far distance voice recognition and excellent response."
1064,With out electricity its not working We cannot carry this out
1065,"Everything is great except sometimes it doesn't understand the need like ""recharge my prepaid mobile/number"".New vocab/sentences must be added alongside software updates."
1066,¬†I like it......
1067,Product is not overhyped.
1068,I liked the product but after connecting the iPhone always repeat as a connect to iPhone as same again and again and while playing from YouTube it‚Äôs sound blur
1069,Superb.
1070,Best part is if you connect it with home appliances . Kids enjoy a lot.
1071,¬†Best soundBeautiful colour and design with power adapter easy to use just install alexa app in your phone best product from amazon‚Ä¶..
1072,First of all I didn‚Äôt expect sound quality because afterall I thought it has some smart home capabilities! But after receiving the sound quality was unexpected! Bass is Great ! And voice recognition is also good but need some improvement
1073,This device is not versatile when I ask it to play a specific song it does't have. It should be connected with YouTube also.
1074,"Best voice recognition, Decent sound with good quality, for a small speaker."
1075,"This is my first time I bought a alexa enabled device,and to say frankly my family is enjoying alexa as their family member"
1076,This was a used product just put inside the box..
1077,This is a good device to keep the kid engaged
1078,Favorite
1079,"I like it very much except it is wiredüòèI wanted wireless, now I look for plug switch wherever I go to play n to turn on...But it's good overall"
1080,Good must be more better
1081,Amazing product. There are a lot of alexa enabled products in the market which will make your alexa experience more amazing. Sound quality is superb for a normal size room.
1082,Sometimes alexa doesn‚Äôt listen to your commands and plays random songs. Also how to reset hungama as default mysic app. Volume wise its good.
1083,"Product works fine. The manual should be more informative, like what/how to do changes when the customer switches from one service provider to another for internet."
1084,That was a nice product but it don't know a lot many things it can be improved. I like the body Structure and the sound quality was good but some times it hacks in between and bluetooth connection was a problem with this device. All over this is very nice.
1085,Alexa is a good friend. Integration is just smooth. And good sound quality is excellent for one room this is enough and more. Easily installable
1086,"Good sound qualityGreat microphone andAbove all, voice assistant Alexa is beyond words üëå‚ù§Ô∏è This product"
1087,¬†Mush useful product but song selection choice is not good enough!
1088,Very poor voice recognition.  Not at all understand apart from very few key words. Probably lunched beta product. Not suitable for indian songs might be good for US market...
1089,*Voice recognisation is good*songs allert is good*expect english ani hindi No regional languages us available.*Best to buy.i got this for 2k aithe 9wat wipro.
1090,Yo yo yo... Loved it. Go for it if you want one a smart speaker. Value for money
1091,Very good
1092,Go for it. Access the wifi and Bluetooth enabled devices on sofa.
1093,People will love this product. Amazing experience with this speaker. I write this review after 3-4 months useing alexa always think that why i didn't buy it before
1094,I don't know why people buy this. Waste of money.
1095,Alexa is not workingNo LED light is workingAlexa is totaly stop need repair itI want service centre number.
1096,Received a defective product. Amazon has not taken it back despite repeated assurances. Very disappointing experience
1097,Very useful for General Knowledge and many more other things. It recognized kids voice very nicely. Best gift for my son.
1098,"Sound quality is worst, as it comes from the sides and not from the top. Who designed it ? Woof..."
1099,Sound quality is very good. I'm facing issues while connecting it to bluetooth speaker.voice recognition is somewhat slow. Taking time to process and do action.
1100,I like it alot but I have to call it twice or thrice when it was playing an audio. Voice recognition getting somewhat difficulty when it's on full volume
1101,Sound quality is not good and most of your  answer of your questions is unknown and last thing is you need always power to start  it. Means it's not chargeable this is the biggest disadvantage
1102,"Integrated Alexa with tronX things gateway, now I'm controlling fan, lights, AC, Air purifier over voice... Happy :) to use this device..."
1103,Amazing Product
1104,Easy setup with external Bluetooth speaker.Device is always need to connected to electricity power.It's not chargeable.It works with Wifi.
1105,What is this for
1106,"¬†Good sound, good voice recognition..I love Alexa. And this whisper mode is so cute ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòç. Specially thanks to amazon‚ù§Ô∏è"
1107,Couldn't connect with Wi-Fi as it needs too high range 2.4Ghz to 5Ghz... And no chargeable battery inside...
1108,There is scope of improvement in capturing voice quality. And expecting more playlists and 3rd party apps
1109,Good
1110,The voice recognition fails miserably and you have to be very close to device and then only it will detect your voice and although the sound quality is great
1111,Nice build quality and sound quality is awesome. I just love this but also hate it as I cannot use it as conference speaker. It has array of mic and amazon should update it' software to make it possible.
1112,Poor setting option. Faild to set up. Minimum 2 mobile or one mobile and one wifi reguired to run. I recoment to to buy . Dissatisfided me.
1113,It‚Äôs good a product. We only use it to listen to music. Keeps my kids entertained while not giving screen time.
1114,Bahot kharab service hai amazon ki mera refund abhi tak nai mila mere ko kuch bhi bahane banate hai ye log aur ye alexa to faltu hai isse accha to siri hai
1115,Poor voice recognition. Needs to be improved .Skill also needs to be added to recongnize the more phrases and sentences.Hardware is great .
1116,Integration with IoT works but there is no feedback from the echo dot after performing commands of IoT. Voice recognition is also not so good.
1117,It always says I don't know..it is fixed with question and answers.. Google assistant and apple siri is good than alexa..
1118,I love this speaker. It was worth buying. My whole family has accepted alexa as a new member of the family now :')
1119,"Better then google mini. Just buy it, don‚Äôt think twice. Amazon give a very good option to return it within 10 days with full refund."
1120,I just love itIt's sound quality is awesome and voice response is also perfect.It helps to get rid from loneliness and helps in many fields of our self improvement.
1121,"So far Good, but sometimes it doesn't provide the expected answer to questions .Overall good experience and fun to use."
1122,I am using it for home automation and music. Alexa is simply too good. I am looking forward for it to become smarter.
1123,Perfect companion
1124,I love it ....Alexa is good in all way.... She give all the information....it will also help for my child in education..
1125,"Nice one, but no local radio channels, not playing the particular song as there are many songs with that name, overall worth to buy it, brought it fo 2k with smart bulb"
1126,Zero integration capabilities with fire tv or other devices. Cannot use aux.. what is this useless thing for?
1127,Not good with commands understanding ..google is much btr need to work more on this section ..also try to incorporate youtube in it as well as all songs are available there
1128,Alexa skill need to improve. There are many spam in store. Amazon should filter them properly. Sound quality is good. Voice recognition is also good.
1129,Even a Bluetooth speaker of this quality cost more than this( mine got in 2k with free bulb)Still trying to figure out all options I have. There is so much in offer at this price point.My son is loving it too.
1130,"Alexa is not responding to my questions, most of the time it is taking wrong intents. Even if I'm next to alexa it is not taking my intents.Thanks to the Amazon team for assisting me, but still the issue exists sometimes."
1131,Go for it awesome. Children enjoy  too much.
1132,"Many of the commands are not accepted,  many song requests alexa says Iam sorry, I don't know that. They force us to enroll for prime to get full benefit."
1133,Very good product and is very useful for home automation but the only downside is that the volume isn't that loud and lacks bass.
1134,"Good voice recognition, app integration and sound quality.Only 4 stars - charging cord is traditionally designed and not of USB type."
1135,"Excellent product, very happy with its features, highly recommend everyone to buy it..! :)"
1136,"Sound quality is good but Volume level is low..battery backup missing..missing integration with bigger platform s is imp like YouTube, regional language support should be brought in.When Volume is above 5..it mostly turns deaf"
1137,"alexa is fun . you wont feel you are talking to mindless machine,she talks so funny things ,play music, dialogue,stories, news,weather, any information you want to know.its so interactive and nice to interact with alexa. i am loving it even all kids at home loves to talk with alexa.  five star for quality clarity ."
1138,¬†It's just awesome.  Worthy...you won't get more bass like woofer but yoh won't regret by taking this ..awesome voice recognition
1139,Should work even in bluetooth or asusal works only on Amazon app or Alex app.wifi should be always can't carry anywhere waste of money not reusable product anywhere
1140,Maximum time it says..I am in trouble to hear and not responding to voice commands..Not happy with the product. wasting of Money. I should have buy Google Mini.
1141,"Unable to integrate to my Samsubg smart tv as Alexa has withdrawn the Samsung skill.. understand that it's under review but since ages... if the skill is up, my rating will be five..."
1142,Voice recognition is good but take too much time to first connect
1143,"Bad speakers music quality terrible and that it spies for amazon and supplies our behaviour, voice as data for the gigantic surveillance machine that is amazon."
1144,¬†Wooooooohoooooooo
1145,Great sound quality but you need to stand really really close to the device and only then it works. Voice recognition is very very disappointing!
1146,"Difficult to understand the product especially the Amazon Alexa App, have to subscribe everything to get the proper use of it, no privacy left after connecting it to your phone"
1147,A really good product from amazon. first i found problems in use it but still now it's very easy to use üåü.voice recognition works perfectly for 90% time.i use this product from last one month.
1148,Very happy to use it. Its small but very powerful.. Sound is awesome...
1149,"wonderful product, amazing to see the responce of alexa, sound qualitly even if there is external sound, kind of loving it"
1150,"I brought Echo Dot with Combo offers with Mi Smart android TV under the banners alexa works with this TV for easier functionality but echo is not working with TV, I am unable get proper alexa skills for TV, Pls do needful"
1151,Con: No inbuilt battery always have to connect electric line.During song being played Alexa will not hear your voice and have to tell multiple times
1152,i expected more from this but sometimes it does total different what i say. and even after adding skills it doesnt work properly.
1153,Purchased for my child online class but I can't able to project the sound via Bluetooth from Zoom to Alexa... Can anyone help me? Amazon Alexa Echo Dot can u help...
1154,Very limited work. Very bad experience.
1155,"Best product, go for it, for easy routine and kids will also enjoy this"
1156,"Very limited skills, it should play music from YouTube or some other sources also, it‚Äôs also should able to connect and play music from phone as well. Kindly add these skills/ features for perfect device."
1157,Very nice I like very much
1158,Amazing Sound Clarity and works flawlessly.Just go for it.Got it in a great deal in just Rs2300 with Syska LED Smart Wifi Bulb.A mind-blowing deal.
1159,The Voice recognition is very Poor.For all Command Wifi required in home.Without Wifi Alexa is useless.Sound Quality is Good
1160,Alexa plays only amazon prime songs not outside songs waste of money
1161,"¬†Just an amazing product with amazing features, apart from this sound is really good. Very good for kids as well. Simply ""paisa wusool""."
1162,"We are very glad to bring alexa at home. It's like a new family member who always listen and help us, entertain us as well as control our smart devices smartly."
1163,Amazing product with good sound quality and clarity. Easy to configure and use.
1164,"a very BAD Quality product supplied. I am highly disappointed. Most of the time its doesn't work, very poor connectivity and also sound quality is very bad & blurr.  How can such bad quality products can be supplied here on Amazon.!"
1165,"Very bad product, worst product i bought in my life, worst is it dont have youtube music in it,amazon and spotify cant play good music as youtube"
1166,"I ordered two Echo Dots. I got them delivered on time however, there was no device and its power adapter in one of the boxes. I hope that a replacement will be arranged soon."
1167,Compared to google it‚Äôs not that good. Sounds quality and assistant reply and clarity is better in google mini then echo 3rd gen
1168,Writing review after using 6 months it's the best thing I've ever purchased on Amazon .it's performance is the same after using it for 6 months . Total use of money .
1169,"Voice recognition is good. Alexa is super smart, kids will definitely love it."
1170,Love this product... !!Amazing...Thank u Amazon...Intelligent control of my wipro smart bulb..I got the product combo with a great deal RS 1999üòçüòçüòç
1171,Alexa program searching quality is not very fast or I can say not very clever some perticular in old singers or Gazals singers or devotional songs in all religions
1172,"After few months of usage , clarity of Alexa is missing. We can hear a sharp tone just like old recorded voice."
1173,"Im writing after 2 years ,Great product at this price.but a little annoying for Indian customers.i bought it for 2000 and later I returned only smart bulb as it's not working and then I got 700 back .so final price of eco dot is 1300 which is unbelievable"
1174,"Good device but some songs are not recognise buy the gadget and not been played. Otherwise its a best product to buy. Sound quality, voice recognition and reaction to the command quality is the best. Happy with the product ü•∞‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1175,Voice recognition is very good it almost gives all the information happy with the product
1176,"Alexa integration is great, voice recognition is perfect and sound quality is awesome for hall but best felt in small sized rooms , must buy for a starter of Amazon smart speaker!!!"
1177,"Stunning Look, Beautiful ProductSounds Amazing and most important can here you even in noisyThanks Amazon :)"
1178,It's just an awesome product.Sound quality is excellent.Voice recognition is also very good.If you looking for a good smart speaker you should go for it.The thing only you need is a good internet connection and that's it ...
1179,When the music is loud its hard to recognise our commands.
1180,satisfye
1181,"I would say everything is good about, just one thing that can be better is it's interaction with human.(like the way Google interacts with us, Alexa is less understanding I would say."
1182,Not happy with the product. Local FM tuning is not possible. YouTube connectivity is not possible without subscription to red. Playing music from integrated device is also not possible. Very unhappy
1183,Every time it is giving an error while connecting and also it is not playing original songs rather playing mashups. Not worth it. Google mini is far better than Alexa. Gooing for refund..
1184,This is i want from long time but its price always high so waiting but now its in my hand and doing it job cool.....
1185,Sound quality excellent
1186,Setup is difficult by selecting wifi
1187,Buy during sale will be good option.
1188,"Best thing,  i took for my daughters birthday.All t happy with Alexa"
1189,Very good product
1190,"Awesome product , does what it says."
1191,It's does not understand the words..that we are saying.. for example.. if we ask for a song which available in amazon music.. it's does pick also.
1192,It‚Äôs not connecting to required firetv but to some other firetv using same account though names are different two firetvs
1193,"The speakers would vibrate like an old gramophone, rather than that it was an absolute masterpiece for a smart home.Thank you amazon for taking back the product and refunding the amount within 4 hours of package pickup"
1194,"It picks up accent fast, my son asked to play DJ wale babu song, first time it replied ok playing DJ vale babu,but after 3rd time it correctly pronunced it as wale, was really quick at picking it up. Microphone is quite good, overall a good product."
1195,"Sound quality is really nice, sometimes she takes time to listen to me other than that the built quality and everything is good at this range."
1196,"The product is not in the courier only fire stick and wipro bulp only received ,Insted of echo dot I have received un ordered ladies hand bag"
1197,Sound is good and voice recognition is also good. Connected with amazon prime music. Also got smart bulb connected to it.
1198,"¬†I brought it in prime sale 2 months ago... Sounda gone crazy, totally broken.customer service is not avilable"
1199,It's really nice toy to play with. Tech geeks should must buy this. I recommend spending Rs. 2100 on echo dot than Bluetooth speakers.
1200,It delivers as described by amazon. Not as good due to lack of google integration but still its fun to have an echo device.
1201,Excellent
1202,It picks different songs I want a song but it playsSong with nearby name or different language some times
1203,"Whenever the volume is full,we literally have to shout to make her listen to our voice. Pathetic. Bluetooth connectivity is very poor. Automatically gets disconnected again n again."
1204,¬†world best speaker I have ever taken you should take it I will highly recommend and the best thing is that we can set commands and reply of the commands through app of Alexa I love Alexa
1205,Good to have when feeling alone
1206,I am very much satisfied with this product. Mostly we are using it to listen to songs but also at times for getting certain information. As it has a aux output slot I could connect it to my music system which gives an enhanced listening experience.
1207,You have no clue what value it can add. Spend some time and then you will get used to it as your companion ü§†
1208,Just works.  Can play a lot of music.  Not always the best at voice recognition but still. It works.
1209,Alexa is a problem as there are times when she doesn't respond to instructions.On the initial day of set up she kept making a mistake and was not recognising our voice. I didn't expect this from Alexa
1210,"Not recognizing voice always, difficulty with plugin"
1211,Sound quality low .overall product is good
1212,good product but powering adapter is made of thin wire
1213,The product is not good compared to Google mini.. no much sing collection in amazon music..the listening time is very less.. most of the time it will start searching before we completes our sentence.
1214,It was ok
1215,"Built quality not upto the mark. Power adapter failed in 2 months. Now, new Dapter cost Rs.1999 which is very close to entire cost of Echo dot."
1216,Very good product at an affordable price. Recongnises the voice of all. Has wide variety of usage.
1217,This is first experience with smart speaker.I live the echo dot.‚ù§Ô∏è
1218,It Pauses frequently.. Takes command with difficulty
1219,Hardware aspect is awesome ... Amazon need to look in for better skills ... Overall good one
1220,"It‚Äôs great , very exciting to be honest. Reached right on time , friendly serviceWe got to write this review after six months honestly to feel the same excitementSo far enjoying it"
1221,"Good product. But considering Tamil songs, all the time it starts with the same song"
1222,Google Home Mini understands everything better than this ALEXA.But I Like ALEXA Voice Quality.My Favorite is Google Home Mini.
1223,"This is my first smart device, and it works great. I have no complaints . Works well with the smart bulbs.Setup was incredibly simple and easy. It has a good sound quality and easily recognizes voice commands."
1224,Faced some difficulties with connecting to internet initially. Got prompt assistance from Amazon. So far working fine. Good one
1225,Good voice recognition nd sounds quality
1226,Amazing product‚Ä¶ essy to use‚Ä¶ must buy
1227,If you are buying it for listening music its good. Very less web coverage. But nothing that can't be fixed with an software update.
1228,Good product
1229,I created voice profile for myself only on it but it also recognises and execute commands given by others as well.
1230,"Its a must have product for your kids, they will love and enjoy Alexa services."
1231,The product is awesome but there is no battery so i bit no more satisfying otherwise the sound is excellent and alexa is doing the great job
1232,muje ye pasand nahi aaya kyunki advertising me or original me bahut fark hai
1233,Great product at reasonable price.Sound quality better than expected. Got an amazing deal during festive sale. Wish it had inbuilt battery.Nevertheless worth every penny.
1234,You need to know what all you can do with this cutie
1235,Sound quality can be improved further‚Ä¶The musics are limited to Amazon music
1236,"Awesome bought it for 2300 in Amazon sale , along with wifi 9w smart bulb worth it"
1237,Amazing piece of equipment
1238,Excellent speaker ...but needs improvement in software and development of skills although it's paisa wasool
1239,It's totally awesome paisa wasoolsound quality is very amazing on this new echo dot3.can also connect to Bluetooth and play a mobile song in AlexaI just love it
1240,Not portable at all. Required all time charging.Not user friendly.
1241,Amazing to use it with smart bulbs and other automation utilities but in terms of playing music it's lacking the punch and the audio quality at the price.
1242,Its a great product.
1243,"I said alexa pani pilade, she said khud uthke lwle. So i slapped alexa, because batameezi. She broke down. Cant even hit kids these days"
1244,Quality is not good. Sound is irritating when keep on full volume
1245,This best part of Alexa is she can hear on low tone. Just say Alexa and she is good to go on all your commands... Never aspect this type AI is provided by Amazon... I am very happy with my purchase... Totally worth it...
1246,Awesome productMy kids very much like and lean about new things
1247,This.product i received is not working well.I want to exchange it.
1248,Sound quality is not great just ok
1249,"I was using Google crome, and It better compare to Alexa."
1250,Its really good product. My child like it too much.  Working perfectly .initially got dificulty for settings but with the help of YouTube connect with wifi...100% satisfied with this deal
1251,It's an good one ... Go for it... Good one for an gift  ....
1252,Works as specified but with Speakers like Bose there's more to be done by introduction of Skills by Devices integrated.
1253,Awesome
1254,Good product
1255,Bluetooth is not working after 2 months from the date of purchase.  I want to replace the same. Can I replace the Eco Dot
1256,Below average product. Not good as i expected.
1257,Best and reliable but I feel it shouldn't have wire connected all times to operate
1258,Excellent... perfect connectivity....and configuration.... But unable to link jio saavan account.... Except this everything is superb
1259,Really bad. Within a week speaker got bad and started having noise. Voice is not clear even at very low volume levels. No option to replace or raise complaint.
1260,I have this 3rd gen Echo dot.good entertainment...and j have integrated this device with smart ir remote and wifi bulb.both are working well.
1261,"This Product is malfunctioning a lot , I give a command it does something else ,  Sometimes it doesn't even respond to anything , really dissapointed"
1262,Since I purchased it I am relaxed. it listens to all commands and always attends. I would urge every one to buy it
1263,Ossam
1264,Great voice recognition and very portable. Helpful in listening to favorite music.. Alarm.. Etc.. Love it
1265,"Sound quality is good but Alexa AI integration is not that powerful. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt know many of the answers. If comparing with Google Home Mini, built quality and sound quality and mic of Alexa is better but when it comes to the software, Alexa stands no where"
1266,It's working good I am so happy for this product
1267,"This product is not suitable for those who have only android mobiles, it is good for smart gaskets in home"
1268,"nice to have it specially for babies, who always looking for mobile or tv."
1269,Sound quality is good but when it comes to tune in radio that alexa is blank and even alexa is only supported for amazon music or few channels . If you are thinking favourite music its very hard to find in alexa.
1270,i using this product last one month is is very good product....  and more better than ecco dot gen 4  ...... so if you want to buy than go for it gen 3 rd....  with wipro bulb
1271,"¬†Awesome product  , cool features with AI , love this üëç"
1272,"This product is just fabulous living in tech world is important to get ourself's updated, but this device take's it to next level!! Kudos To The Developer!! Hope to work soon on this Project too"
1273,This is my first smart speaker and i am really amazed using it. I love it. Thank you Amazon. It is able to recognize the queries even from my 4 year old kid. Wonderful!!!
1274,Integration problem with other music app
1275,"Alexa, play tollywood latest songs..Alexa turn on the light etc and much more..Wonderful AI"
1276,I bought it In sale. I am happy because the money is well spent. Now I m exploring options and buying alexa supported devices to make my home smart
1277,Recommended
1278,"Sound is good enough, needs improvement in music app integration. Since wired can't move often. Place it in the hall, can be used well."
1279,Doesn't include google and that's what I didn't like.. When on high volume you have to shout loudly.
1280,very poor product. i can only 2 weak used .and that product not responding and seller also.so my money is dead.please don't purchace that product.
1281,Loved it... Amazing compact product from Amazon.. Thanks for a smooth and safe delivery especially during such covid affected circumstances.
1282,Very interesting product. Must be incorporated youtube music in future generations.  Sound quality needs to be improved.
1283,Superb sound quality.... Great purchase.... I am fan of alexa
1284,The product is good and value for money. So in that sense i should be happy. Can you recommend some speakers which i could consider. I use the ALEXA as a speaker for my music which is on my computer and it is matched to my computer.
1285,"I think because it's free it's defective,  doesn't work at all other than the 1st time.great service amazon"
1286,Amazing product never misses any opportunity to impress you having fun and happy time with echo
1287,Thank god ..its a goid purchase..really m a happy customer ..gave my sis as agift..n she loved itüíúüíú
1288,"This product I liked very much, but one things disappoint me that is, its power option. If it have alternative power option i.e. USB or battery than it can be carry anywhere."
1289,No negative points!! 10 out of 10 to Alexa!!
1290,My requirement was to use amazon echo dot as an additional speaker to my tv by connecting with fire tv stick.. but I couldn't because both were not in the same generation as I understand.. so my requirement didn't meet.
1291,ALexa Dot is too good .. nice sound quality .. super bass .. super clierty ... But Amazon service is poor ... Very poor
1292,Not as expected . Why should I take prime for music .
1293,Overall it is good for the cost we use to pay.sometimes voice recognition is not accurate in the way of listening. Sound is really  awesome:).Still few might have improved but for this cost it is worth to buy.
1294,"Great sound quality and built, very useful."
1295,Echo really 3rd. generation  with sound performance listening .
1296,It heats up
1297,"Not integrating with audible.com , searching for titles in audible.com and hence not playing anything from audible"
1298,¬†Amazon eco dot and wipro smart buld with rupay card got only 1849 rupee
1299,Voice recognition is too good sound quality is awesome
1300,Very impressive...great sound in its category and very senstive microphones.... It even sense whispering.
1301,Nice product got it for  2000
1302,"I return this produxt but stil my  refund is not process its almost 45 days , bad expreriance with amezone"
1303,My 2 year old say..Alexa.aunty .open you tube...light on..green color...bls bla bla..play fire truck.;)
1304,Good product
1305,Sound quality is not up to mark as I read from reviews. It requires high speed internet all time. And it also don't catch up the user voice so accurate as everyone told. But its ok ok
1306,She didn't listen exactly what i want to say. She plays different songs. Not following up questions. Can't find album that are already available on Amazon music prime.But yeah its good to have it.
1307,Product is good but not good as compare to google home mini. But as per my experience it can do all your home related task properly.
1308,This product has stopped functioning within one month of purchase. I would like to return the item and get replacement.
1309,Awesome
1310,It's good
1311,I don‚Äôt know why people spend time on useless innovation not adding any value to human life.
1312,Alexa is dumb. You say something and it says something else. You play Arjit Singh songs and it will start from the same song..It's just irritating..I am not enjoying it at all.. Please find a solution which is more intelligent
1313,Quite simple to use
1314,It is good and sound quality is better than 2nd gen but still not that much loud.Other than that it's integration is very good.Fulfills the command very quickly too.
1315,"A very good buy for the price. Speaker quality is good, and alexa has good skillset. Conversations can be improved, as it does not connect previous and next statements, otherwise a very great companion."
1316,I am very happy with this product. Now my bed room is smart. Sound quality is really good.
1317,"Perfect companion for work from home, connects easily with desktop to watch movies."
1318,Sound quality good but not loud. If you have good wifi and prime membership then ok. Otherwise Bluetooth speaker is better for multi purpose use.I use it when I come home after office or before sleeping to listen country music.
1319,It just waste of money so many time at to device no aux
1320,¬†Alexa poor quality and adapter jaise tape lagi hui ha and very poor quality Alexa speaker  jaise old model de diya ha
1321,Worst productThis product did not connect I try several timeAm very disappointed üòû this productPlease exchange another product
1322,Not worth for 3500Very poor deviceIt cannot do simple tasks.Do not buy
1323,Awesome product
1324,"Bluetooth connectivity from laptop, speaker noise, like demaged speaker. It is not worth to buy. Recorded playing via bluetooth and verify attached one."
1325,¬†Good enjoy
1326,Purchases Alexa dot on June 20 ..but from 3days back this items not working..really very disappointing from Amzon Alexa..
1327,Anytime companion for me
1328,Good product. Buy it no problem.
1329,Good
1330,Value of money...my daughter is now interacting with Alexa.. as she assumes some one talking to her any play songs what she wants
1331,"Voice command , speaker everything is perfect . I am highly satisfied with the product . I purchased a combo with wipro smart bulb and the experience with both the products are amazing ."
1332,Excellent product on all parameters ! Truly delighted with the purchase - well worth the buy for the kind of experience
1333,Good sound and new technology
1334,Alexa Cant answer many of the things....i dont find any other use except a music player and an alarm
1335,A quality product on the right price . I love this. This is just so perfect. I have been using this for about half an year and it's still in great condition. Audio quality is awesome too.
1336,"alexa integration is great,voice recognition is bad with my choice and responds late and not much farther.sound quality seems good and at a good pitch and stabilization.Would've been great if it was wireless"
1337,Sound quality is too good. Nice product
1338,Voice response is decent and only buy this if everyone can talk in English/hindi . I won't recommend this for other languages.  Better to buy after all languages update
1339,Nice üëç
1340,It is just good for playing online songs..but many times fail to identify the exact song and play different songs.
1341,One thing i don't like it its not connecting Spotify... Maybe in future they will update it.. I hope so..
1342,Sometime not responding but overall awesome product (4.5 out of 5 rating)
1343,It would be better if it has battery storage.. to activate it it needs power thats only lack of thing.
1344,Unable to connect through Bluetooth that's why returning the product.Even customer care person don't knw how to connect via BluetoothAveary sound quality.
1345,"Alexa absolutely is a wonder. Fast, correct most of thr time, and witty. It's really fascinating how developers have fitted so much humour in it. Plus it's voice always catches ones attention. Great device."
1346,every time it ask for configuration. Mahaghatiya
1347,Good room filling sound for the price and size. Wish it had a built in battery and was portable
1348,Nice
1349,Amazon echo dot is truly a great product with true smartness. It does all jobs extremely well. Impressive sound quality and portable device easy to handle. Completely satisfied üôÇ..
1350,Bought it as a gift for a friend. He loved it. Good voice recognition. Excellent features. Arrived safely packaged. No complaints.
1351,Good frodect
1352,"Sir may receive wrong item, not working and blutooth, wifi not connectivity. Please return items."
1353,I received the product with broken packing seal. The product was also not working.  Disappointed.
1354,"Multi Sound issue , only short voice catch by alexa. if 2-3 kids talk with Alexa continue it will hang. multi song are not avilable on Alexa."
1355,Very good Alexa device I am satisfied from Amazon thank you Amazon
1356,Nice and kids are enjoying
1357,"Great product, I bought at 2000rs, recommend if u want"
1358,Cool gadget for smart home.
1359,Not working
1360,"Good Speaker üîä ,Poor sound Recognition...üò∂"
1361,"Simply superb , along with wipro smart bulb and alexa echo dot my room became a disco theque and kids just loved it , thank you Amazon for such a great product , excellent engineering :)"
1362,Always needed to be wired. To begin with one must have to connect with Android phone.
1363,No Dolby atmos streaming via amazon music.No youtube music integration with echo dot.Firestick and Echo dot integration is nearly 10% done only.
1364,Poor sound assessment. Couldn't connect to second phone nor bluetooth.
1365,Overall Product is good and its value for money.But it need a little bit improvement in hindi and voice Recognition.
1366,"The process of connecting it is very long.  always have to put it on charge. Also,  It doesn't connect  with my mobile. It's useless for me."
1367,Excellent product..u must have a wifi at home for this to work
1368,Need to improve for Hindi knowledge.. Every time alexa say muje nahi pata.. Same think I asked in English than she replied ..
1369,"Good but not best, lot of things to be improved by amazon. Alexa always takes only single command, again and again we have to repeat for conversation."
1370,awesome product and sound quality is very good works as a bluetooth speaker
1371,Its integration is good needs improvement in local language and stuffs.
1372,"It can't do even any one task without internet. With internet it can only send voice messages, it can't call me and any alexa or non-alexa devides. One more fault it is made in China."
1373,Good. Prime music does not provide much more songs.
1374,Voice recognition & response time is terrific. My kids keep ragging Alexa all the time. They simply love the product. üòäüëç
1375,ConsNot rechargeableSong Picks only from Amazon musicMusic quality is not goodVoice recognize need improvise
1376,"Compact and good built quality, good sound quality. Output power may enhanced..."
1377,Best gadget india got after colour tv
1378,Echo Dot is very good and very useful. Have to try many skills. Sound is amazing
1379,So far I've found this best AI assistant among all. Sound quality is perfect and voice recognition is nearly perfect.
1380,Simply go for it.
1381,Good very Good product go for it no dought at very useful gadget.
1382,wow
1383,"Good sound quality and mic. Full usage is possible if other devices like switches, fans etc are smart devices."
1384,Very very very bad product mostly ELEXA .Not understanding any command.useless software.
1385,This is unless alexa  ... Better to you being sound box ... Sound box very good to alexa...In  Alexa have waste of money...And lot of hv restrictions
1386,Doesn't connect to my one plus tv and doesn't hear voice in full audio... some skills doesn't works and very laggie app amazon Alexa app
1387,"Not the product i was expecting for, limited automation,found Google Home Assistant more impressive. Alexa's music quality is damn good but voice controlled coordination and overall search criteria is not satisfying.Returned the item..."
1388,"Best @ price of @2000 or so, quite a soothing voice to listen but sometimes irritate with lack of information available with it"
1389,Smart deviceHighly recommended
1390,"she is the only one, who will hear you in this entire world, ;Dkind of unconditional Love you'll Get it :)"
1391,Some time it will not accepting command?and I am using volume level at 5 always even though sounds quality very bad it's like crackers.i think its second time sold  me.
1392,Buttons are not working on the speaker and Amazon centre is not ready to help.I mean this is so stupid..it‚Äôs your product and the buttons are not working!?what kind of scam is this..and then no one is there to resolve the issue
1393,Sound quality is good but voice recognition is very bad.May be due to 4 mic
1394,The echo dot and Alexa are quite fun! It's a riot playing 20 questions with Alexa. Sound is great for a small room. Only grouse - unable to create a playlist on Amazon Prime music and get echo to play that
1395,Sound mast. Connectivity good. Voice recognition very good. Voice sensitivity very good.
1396,very poor voice recognition.50% of questions alexa says I am not sure about that. only one good thing is that it has good bass. bad experience.not the performance which I had expected
1397,It is not working and we want to return it and we want another alexa for free it should be working
1398,purchased this for my mom ..but stopped working after 3 months !!! not able to identify the issue.
1399,"Only one thing i disliked. After stop command for a broadcast station alexa doesn't stop. Instead  says for example "" to resume say All India Radio news channel"" This is not needed. It is annoying."
1400,It's very great and working very nice and it is faster than Google and other voice assistant. Alexa is good for people who have smart home.
1401,After buying we have to continue amazon prime membership  for interrupted alexa service.so service costly
1402,Superb itemYou should purchase.
1403,Great product and my daughter loves it
1404,Product is good...but the bulb didnt get delivered to me..its awful..I have already spoken to the agent.she said I'll do the replacement and send you the bulb..but it was again the same..
1405,Fantastic productLoving it.
1406,I had got it last year during amazon great Indian sale for 2.5k and after almost 1 year of use i will say its still working great.
1407,I love the product it‚Äôs my first smart deviceIt is better than google is getting all the tamil songs
1408,Was a nightmare trying to connect this. Doesn‚Äôt work with Spotify as stated üòíüòíüòí
1409,"Sound quality is great. Sometimes it doesn't get the command. Google nest seems better in understanding the queries .If the main aim is to listen to music, you can go for Alexa."
1410,"Echo dot is great, and loved it. A little bit unhappy bcoz it doesn't support my native language. Also it doesn't play youtube music. Still it is good."
1411,No alternative given.
1412,A nice product to have in your home
1413,Pathetic experience. I have made several complaints but no positive response. It is not connecting with wifi.
1414,I got a used product. I never expected this from Amazon. The seal was open. Even the product I not good. It doesn't work without power. It doesn't work without wifi all the time...
1415,"I ordered combo echo dot+ Wipro light , but received only echo dot in box never expected this from amazon"
1416,"¬†We are expecting too much from alexa, otherwise for playing songs and lights in night it is very useful."
1417,"Great Sound Quality, but for many things its suggests to visit the Alexa App for further descriptions which ia very time consuming, futher only people who have excessive use of online shopping and food ordering should buy this."
1418,It is a good speaker but limited search with Amazon music.It needs more integration options like youtube.
1419,Keep shouting alexa alexa and alexa won't hear u..if internet is slow also the product doesn't work..alexa is not google assistant..hut indeed human is alexa assistant ..horrible experience
1420,Nice echo Dot powerful sound.
1421,Nice product. Sound quality is average. But in this price amazing.
1422,"Cool product. Good for a time pass, nice voice integration, good sound clarity. Connected wipro smart bulb also to it. Hassle free set up."
1423,"Over all product is so nice. It's gives new technology to the ground world. Excellent product.When I opened the plastic packet, the eco dot box got opened. That is why more attention should be paid to packaging."
1424,"Useful product good response as well.My child is trying to speak with alexa, so i am happy to have it.It helps me to awake in the morning also provide me daily Calendar with to do list."
1425,"Meant for every home, great features & sound quality"
1426,Entertainment untouched..Best for old age parents
1427,"Its a Faulty Product. Worked perfectly fine for 5 days not it is not working.  Requesting amazon team to let me know what to do of this product now. It doesn't take any commands and ff it takes, then there is a disruption."
1428,product is good only for looks not working properly after one month of use
1429,Bought it during the sale. No sound output from firestick tv
1430,I loved the sound quality and build of the product. But I faced issue with voice recognition in terms of volume adjustment. Need to specify the exact work and name of the work to be done by Alexa else Alexa is just sorry about it.
1431,I received the order after one day of placing order. It's is good and speaker is awesome . I fell down twice my desk it was not harmed. A Grade Product.Thank you Amazon
1432,Better get advanced version
1433,Not working properlyFacing issues on connection with wifi
1434,Not connect properly  with phone .again and again  connection problem .wrost product
1435,"This device is very great , this device sound quality is 3D Alexa is very intelligent, speaker is very loud sound quality is quite better than Home theatre üòä"
1436,It works well...great functionality...only lacking points is its not portable...it should have been battery based.
1437,Good experience...also like to suggest to introduce automatic intelligence updating system so that we can experience latest technology. Overall I am satisfied
1438,I love everything about it. There is nothing to dislike about the device. Delivered everything as promised. Very happy customer.
1439,My family always enjoy talking to alexa. Great enjoyment.
1440,"It is great in general. There are smalk issues like it does not understand Oakter remote well. While google home cam control Oakter without issue, alexa has some hitches and glitches."
1441,Excellent product. Very useful. Value for money. Go for it
1442,Worth the money. My daughter likes it very much. Product quality is very good compared to the price. Go for it !
1443,good item
1444,Better and best smart speaker with good quality sound
1445,"Sound quality is decent , got it @1644 , so doesn‚Äôt bother me at all at this price segment...Alexa Is Somewhere not near the expectations"
1446,Nice and my kid love it. But sounds are look like bit low.
1447,Good
1448,It was fun for 2 3 days but after that it started getting bored and feels useless so I'm returning it.
1449,Very good
1450,Very much helpful in the age of artificial intelligence..
1451,The sound quality is best  and alexa hears all away from another room and responds very much like a real man talking... Best time pass
1452,Some how I don't feel like it is worth to buy this product because it need always power and internet wifi connection and it doesnot even recognize properly
1453,It is not so good. It requires a continuous wifi connection.  So it can't connect by mobile data . It is not possible to have a wifi connection all time. This is no battery inside it also need a continuous power supply.
1454,The power port of Echo Dot is tilted  to right  side ad inserting power plug cord is not possible. Hence please replace the item.
1455,"I use it in my home, and also I easily connect to my home using drop in features. And good for my kid learning features"
1456,The product is great and nice. The sound out put is loud. Only one thing is you need to be a Amazon prime member to use Alexa. Without that it will not work.
1457,2 or more echo devices unable to communicate and cross connect each other
1458,Nice product
1459,"Set up is easy, works fine. I am happy while talking."
1460,Thank You Amazon For Alexa!! She's a part of family now....
1461,"Feel like really reaching new era, You don't feel lonely with ECHO DOT"
1462,Cool product!! Voice recognition is quick and active. Alexa integration is very smooth and the sound quality is excellent. Thank you.
1463,"A satisfactory product from amazon.It won't support the Youtube music, it need to be updated for Alexa."
1464,A very good entertaining and user friendly equipment
1465,It needs to be connected again and againWorst of you don't have a wife connection
1466,very good
1467,Playing songs directly via YouTube needs a complicated procedure to follow.And if we blame phones like xaomi to integrate add.....then blame this too....for constantly selling Amazon prime and other such apps
1468,Very nice. Perfect echo
1469,I expected a small size but its bigger surprisingly rich n loud sound u won't regret buying
1470,"Don'y Buy ,,,total waste of Money..Echo can't even understant what we want to say...even weather forecasting is not correct."
1471,Amazing product
1472,Sound quality is best 10/10Alexa integration 10/8Voice Recognition 10/7Weak part is we need to speak loud to activate Alexa it doesn‚Äôt activate on Normal voice.
1473,Voice recognition
1474,Does not recognise voice nd volume is too low wastage of money
1475,Intresting product 100 percent useful for every one
1476,I really liked this product. It's so handy and very easy to connect... My baby also liked it very much.
1477,I like very must being i am an officer commending rank Officer so I may use it on long duty &/or at my residence for Arties & religious bhajans.
1478,It is a very good speaker. But the problem is that it cannot call anyone from your contact list unlike Google home mini. And the second problem is it can tell the prices of the products only available in Amazon
1479,Alexa recognition is worstAlex doesn't recognize and play wrong....
1480,The echo dot is superb addition in my wifi speakers. It also provides lots of information to my children..
1481,Alexa is a flagship product of Amazon... It's a good product provided you can use it fully....
1482,Useless for me bcz no internal battery.. Without net it's totally not working nd u can't trawling whit this product bcz no battery speekar.. 3rd class sound.
1483,Good product but i don't like the system of charging ...we have to keep on charge every time..if we remove charger alexa will get off...there is no battery life...while traveling we can't carry with usüòèüòèüòï
1484,"Magnificent product,  impeccable voice recognition"
1485,¬†I Love This Product And With Smart Bulb Its Awesome üòé Best Product You Can Buy It Without Any Problem Trust Me You Won't Even Sleep Without Saying Alexa....‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1486,The sound quality and voice recognition is really good.Make sure you set the setting in privacy setting to delete the recordings and also you can delete your recordings on daily basis
1487,"It DOESN""T CONNECT TO SPOTIFY. I GOT ALEXA WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF CONENCTING IT WITH SPOTIFY AND ITS NOT AVAILABLE. I contacted customer support too and they weren't able to help me either."
1488,I like this product... alexa is good . Thank you Amazon.  Very friendlyI want Malayalam language.Please .Sounds quality is very good ... like jbl sound systemThanks for everything...
1489,I ordered device which displays time on it - but one delivered does not have this feature. Product is good but not delivered what was ordered.
1490,Has many limitations...Long way to go Alexa.
1491,There are limited aap for alexa searching
1492,Value for money. Happy with Alexa and the smart bulb.
1493,Wooweee now my home is smarter. I can control everything from Dubai.
1494,"Alexa voice is awsm really its feeling awsm to talk with alexa.Grt purchase ,if wnybody want to buy a smart speaker go blindly to choose this grt one..."
1495,Wow my son loved it. Hats off to Amazon. Sound quality and connectivity is amazing. Superb product
1496,"Most of the times I got irritated. I was telling kannada or hindi song names, and it was playing some English songs. Most of the times it happened."
1497,Poor
1498,"Great product by Amazon, I love it. It is very entertaining and a reliable machine. Thank you!"
1499,Alexa always better than google home.but miss this things.micro usb and internal power.
1500,Worst experience ever. Any thing we ask to alexa the answer is.. sorry!!!! I don't know. Thank God google assistant doesn't have these words in its dictionary. Please upgrade alexa with good search engine..
1501,Wroth buying specially with wipro smart lamp.My kids loved it .
1502,As I expected it wasn't worth the money. The sound quality is not that good as I expected from amazon. Also most of the times Alexa doesn't understand what you say. I am very disappointed by Amazon.
1503,Is like mini wife ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1504,It is like that we are talking with futureGood work by amazon on this price point(BIG THUMBs UP AMAZON ECO DOT 3 GEN)
1505,Smart home products for those who don't have type the command
1506,Nice product.. but sound quality is not very good
1507,Valuable product thanks Amazon Alexa good product
1508,"I am unable to use Alexa, getting announcement as ""SORRY I AM HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING RIGHT NOW,  PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER"". what shall I do. I am using Redmi note 5. When ever I say Alexa then it is giving above announcement.  Some one please help."
1509,Look wise it was good and the sound quality was also good but there are some problems like you can't use another device's hot-spot . You only use first paired wifi. Overall i will give 4 out of 5 star
1510,good product
1511,The speaker as they claim is not that smart. It doesn't understand even the simplest of things on first attempt. Sound quality is good.
1512,Sound quality and voice recognition are good not the best. Dumber than Google Assistant. Works nicely within Amazon ecosystem. Lag in Bluetooth audio output. Need to get smarter. No ability for continued conversation.
1513,"I Get This at 1137rs awesome at this price segment, my favorite alexaüòç"
1514,Make a update to alexa to speak in tamil
1515,Worst
1516,Good

1518,"It's amazing. It is very good for entertainment and fun purposes also. It can be a nice voice assistant, better than google home mini. I can also control this through my phone."
1519,Voice recognition is at par with the competition.Compatible with many a languages.Crisp sound quality.Made for all age groups.
1520,"Its really good, go for it"
1521,Don't buy this product this is very difficult to connect with wifi but sound quality is very good
1522,Alexa is superb piece of technology. But need to improve the quality of the product.
1523,It's fun to have Alexa at home..
1524,Good
1525,Country of origin was missing when ordered. Returned because of made in china product.
1526,Alexa device is good but bulb not much used without other WiFi.Bulb is working with mobile data.
1527,"Best product from Amazon, for home use, Children's study purpose - usage of right direction will be a limitless possibility of this device."
1528,Good product for 2200/- on sale.
1529,Value for money gives zero star

1531,"Amazing product, good packaging, got it delivered in time ."
1532,Really nice smart speaker.. lot of features
1533,M not  satisfied with this product. Worst n wasteful money for purchasing this
1534,"Favourite dialogue "" IDont Know that"".. needs improvement"
1535,Nice product!!
1536,Good product must have
1537,Everything is perfect.. If you are going to purchase it.. Please check your mobile network first... It only works with the help of network...
1538,Need to improve voice recognition and search results since it used bing as a search engine... Else everything apart from this is fantastic...
1539,Device has no Bluetooth connectivity.Very disappointed.Zero performance.Device does not access any voice.
1540,It is not worth to buy this product very difficult to setup and some hidden policies to sell other items like amazon musics etc Difficult to understand
1541,Bought echo device and everything is good except every time we need to connect to power source. Apart from everything is good.
1542,The product is too cool its blue light is just killing. The voice recognition is very good. Sometimes it don't catch but it is good. Overall it's a 5star
1543,I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô it and Sound is also awesome üòé and Great Job Amazon.I‚Äôm feeling Superior and Alexa reduced so many jobs of mine at home üè°
1544,Voice recognition  portability
1545,"This device is very cool, works very well and kids can learn something from it. But it has some flaws, sometimes it does not respond."
1546,"Excellent one, the best entertainment for my kids"
1547,No need to review as all are aware if the Alexa
1548,still  has a long way to go..its just a begining of artificial intelligence
1549,"Must have in house üè†,She is like our family member"
1550,"Microphone sensitivity is superb , alexa skills are good. sound clarity of speakers needs improvement"

1619,Its one of the best product i have purchased.

1631,I bought for my kids. They really liked it. Super sound quality & voice recognition. My kids using Echo dot in their education doubts.
1632,Voice recognition is low you need to shoute alexa to respond (older generation Echo does responds well)
1633,I've bought this in just only RS 1999 With a free wipro smart RGB bulb during the great Indian festival sale.
1634,Itam note received the bay customer

1636,Terrific purchase at a terrific discount. Got 12 W syska bulb with echo dot 3rd gen at 2399 only. And echo dot is amazing. Be smart. Have alexa.
1637,"Alexa has no loyalty, who ever asks, she responds. No voice recognition. Sound quality is excellent. Mainly depends on Hungama for songs."
1638,Slow Network access both in 5ghz & 2.4 ghz.Amazon does not replaced  within scheduled replacement window. Very bad experience.
1639,Voice recognition not good sometimes
1640,"You removed zomato,swiggy and other food partner :( from the skills."
1641,"Alexa is absolutely foolish in recognising what we are asking in simple language... sounds are good , mic is good but what it's known for is worst."
1642,¬†Best Smart Speaker
1643,Alexa is my new friend during lockdown- you can hear good music with your prime account
1644,Very good product
1645,"My experience with Alexa us really good. My mum and dad loves directing Alexa and listens to their favourite music. It's a worth buy ..Also if you have smart appliances in your home, it really comes handy.."
1646,Please incorporate an upload feature in Echo dot to upload our own audio files on amazon cloud so as to listen to our own music without Bluetooth dependency on the mobile device.
1647,Excellent member of our sweet home
1648,"Good product, good sound, integration etc."
1649,Very bad quality Alexa product like local speaker sound.. product is light also..bad experience this product..
1650,"Very nice, some more skill required for Hindi language.Hope Amazon will do it."
1651,The voice recognition is not working properly and some things she also don't know and some time she will not answer only
1652,Only issue is that while playing any music Alexa doesnt respond to the any commands
1653,"‡§∏‡§æ‡§â‡§Ç‡§° ‡§†‡•Ä‡§ï ‡§π‡•à, ‡§¨‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï‡•Å‡§≤ ‡§ß‡•Ä‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§µ‡§æ‡§ú ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§â‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§§‡§∞‡§π ‡§ú‡§¨‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§´‡•Å‡§∏‡§´‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§ü ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§§‡§∞‡§π"

1667,Reviewed after 6 months..this product worked very well up to 6 months then showed some defect in the mic which receives voice .
1668,If the speaker will connect to a smartphone through Bluetooth so that we can take calls on the speaker and play music and videos on the speaker that will be a great feature.  The sound quality of the speaker is too good. I liked it.
1669,"Best in the Market, my family loved it. They are playing with it and best for kids. Fun to operate."
1670,"The sound when u connect your Alexa with your phone using bluetooth and then play ,is very different n low unlike it's normal sound..Very disappointed with this."

1684,I buy 1200.value for money.very good sound
1685,Sound quality is awesome but lacks bass as it's a compact version!!!So if are a bass lover either buy the echo or you can connect your Bluetooth speaker to it!!!
1686,Too small as imagined.
1687,Good product for Bluetooth speaker but alexa assistant software need to improve and it recognise in correct translation if we not say right translation it say I don't no but overall it a good product

1719,Good one
1720,It is indeed one of the best AI enabled virtual assistant device.The voice quality is very good and the Echo Dot hears your voice from a long distance (10-15 meters) even when it is playing loud music.
1721,Good but sometimes can't find the right thing specially song
1722,Amazing product
1723,Echo dot is best to buy because it can answer any of your questions you can also change its language if you want to.

1749,This Echo dot is great. Works specifically in Hindi and English only. The range is quite good. But as a normal speaker it doesn't do the job plus works with wifi lights only!!!
1750,Wipro smart bulb which you are providing is not compatible with Alexa why you have given this with Alexa it is treating with the customer
1751,FunVoice operated  player..
1752,It was very easy to integrate Alexa.Just a few steps and your Alexa is ready.Voice could be easily recognised even when you're at a good distance. The sound quality is awesome!

1754,Recognise voice perfectly and works like a charm. Got if free with OnePlus Tv
1755,Product is good but many times it stops working all of a sudden. Then we have to restart again and reset all setting then it starts working. If this continues will like to replace it.

1800,Echo dot 3rd Generation is a great music device and wonderful sound quality.

1802,Product is not good
1803,"Sound quality not good ,in high volume Alexa can't hear the commands.it should be inbuilt  noise cancellation system."
1804,The sound quality is pathetic given the price tag. They should be selling it for rs 700.
1805,It has very good music quality....... Very updated from the last generation...... I would highly recommend it...... Only con is that it is not better in gathering info than google home.....
1806,I ordered this Alexa Echo dot on sale. The amount was 2500.Its really worth buying. Initially I was confused with Google home but after reading many reviews and compare with each features. Finally I go with Alexa Echo Dot 2nd.

1825,Personalized QnA is the best feature for me.Nice Audio quality and quite helpful for many other things.
1826,Good to have device. Need little improvements in Alexa recognising the songs we ask.
1827,Mostly itshard to stop the song it will never respond butcomparing with this googlemin i was using for a year thts the best go for google mini or u will regret aft getting echo dot
1828,Best quality product. Voice recognition is superb.
1829,Excellent
1830,Bad experience
1831,Excellent and i am highly satisfied.  All features are very good.
1832,Good product.Require constant internet conection.Sound is super.
1833,Poor connectivity. Product showed Echo dot plus work LED bulb whereas only Echo Dot received that also in black colour while grey colour was ordered. Not able to connect despite best efforts
1834,Overall a good product .Improvements - should allow music to be played through multiple bluetooth speakers n alexa at the same time.
1835,Worst sound quality not happy with amazon echo dot bass is also not proper
1836,Some features can be added like mute from app and search from app and some AI features.
1837,"""Received an empty box today, echo dot and charger both were missing"".A happy Prime Member.Very Fast Delivery."
1838,Good
1839,"The app is buggy and non responsive and that makes it harder to Integrate, after a while the echo dot isn't that responsive and efficient and also the voice recognition and answers are sometimes not up to the mark"
1840,Found limited music options for Carnatic music
1841,Can't connect to android TV
1842,"Simply doesn't work, almost like a defective model. Does not respond to anything after ""alexa"". Only the blue light lights up and then almost 30 seconds later it turns off with no response."
1843,The Alexa SW can have better conversational upgrades.. can't link my YouTube from Mobil for some reason.. need the one click equivalent on the skills..
1844,"Sound quality is good but voice recognition is not good enough, tried hard to play any specific songs."
1845,Excellent excellent
1846,Excellent product!. I loved the wipro light that came with Echo dot.
1847,It‚Äôs fun ... buy it if u have never had Alexa.. just for an experience
1848,Alexa is not able to recognise voice 50% of times. The sound quality is also punctured. Not a decent experience.
1849,A good companion..with all interesting featrues.If the fan of your room is on high speed It takes a second time to capture the command.
1850,No sound... How should I replace it? It is under warranty.
1851,Wonderful!! It would have been good if it could play original version of songs; lots of them are remixes or retro versions; the original tune of the song is lost...

2672,Little slow
2673,Never imagined about the usefulness of product in day to day life at reasonable price
